We're still confined in our house for days. I don't blame on anyone, while cannot help pondering what might be different if the government could pay more attention to the doctor's claim a month ago.

That doctor is Wenliang Li and he is very young, even one year younger than me. Now he is gone and the grief is everywhere across the whole internet of Chinese community, but not the official.

A month ago, he, among 8 doctors, reported the serious virus to the official but ended up being accused of spreading rumors. He caught the virus and blew the whistle to catch the attention from people and official. And finally official admitted the spreading among humans which was much later retrospecting now.

What might be different if his words had been taken seriously? Or even just give it an investigation before making that bold and false claim which leads the overwhelming situation across the whole country?

Whistleblowers are everywhere and we can remember so many great people and their voice vividly. The whistleblower exposed the phone
call from American president. The whistleblower revealed the scandal of Harvey Weinstein. Or even Edward Snowden himself might be the most famous whistleblower.

In the US, there's even [a program](https://www.whistleblowers.gov/) to protect the whistleblowers from retaliations. Hence, Snowden might be still controversial while he earned a great repute from the masses. Doctor Li might not be acknowledged by the officials while the people won't forget him from now on.

What might be different if he hadn't blown the whistle?

The number might be higher, whatever it is the death, or the infectious persons. It might be more difficult to contain the virus even though we still on the way now. 

Whistleblowers are righteous just like a lot people, while they're brave to blow the whistle which makes them stand out. And that's why everyone is mourning for them today and tomorrow.

Rest in peace, doctor.
