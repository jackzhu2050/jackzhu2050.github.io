Yuval Harari is definitely a well-known writer in China and his sequal was
given to names with shared parts even when there are no such patterns in the
original names. Therefore the publisher could pack them together as a combo
available to sell altogether.

This book might not be the most famous piece of work by him but it is
definitely the most relevant one to ourselves. He tries to explore the issues
we face in the coming decades not centuries, and also the possible solutions to
them, esp. as an individual how we can be ourselves and figure the difficult
problems out.

*Technological challenges* are impending, esp. the *ChatGPT*'s emergence since
last December, which gained so much attention and praise. And then the worry to
ourselves, to our jobs, to the unclear future. Surely *Harari* couldn't predict
the *ChatGPT*, but his worry resonates even more now and the keyword of his
worry is *irrelevance*. This is the 1st time in human's history that we might
be deprived from work involuntarily in such a great population, which surely
would exceed the first industrial revolution when automobiles replaced carts,
and machines replaced weavers, etc. Suddenly we might become irrelvant to the
goods-producing. So will it be a bliss to us or a hell? Will it make the world
more equal or just make even fewer people own more wealth? We will know soon.

Then the *political challenge* is not new to human, which might be there from
the start. Unlike AI which doesn't need a physical agent to pursue its
goals, we human beings have a fragile body that is very easily hurt,
threatened, and destroyed. And we will just duck away when the threat is
somewhere nearby. If everyone just walks away from the danger, surely we would
be still in the ancient time. And then we have religions, and civilization
which can play a key role for your choice-making to forget the fragile bodies, to someone at some times, and it
pushed the society ahead with death and sacrifice.

With the progress of science and technology, a lot of myth has been demystified
and "God is dead". Accordingly, the soul and the afterlife and the rebirth
become less appealing, and we more care about the present life and the present joy.
Gradually, moral values just degraded and we don't care about others and the possible
judgment day. So a lot of cruel things have been done since then. The
post-modern crisis is growing more and more important to us. How to find
meanings of life and how to treat our peers and how to reestablish the spirit
world for us just become more and more urgent.

Last, for individuals, in such an information-overwhelming world, what we should
do first is to become open-minded to things we don't understand; we should be
    able to learn to know the things we don't understand; we should try to be a
    good man with a baseline "don't tell and spread lies"; we should try to
    build a better world for us and for our descendents in both material things
    and the spirit world. Finally, let's no do evil.
