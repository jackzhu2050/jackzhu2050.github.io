I've already had [a blog](https://towerjoo.github.io) for years which are written mostly in Chinese but
mixing some English posts. I don't like such mess for the big difference between the two languages, the
two groups of audience, the different types of content I want to write.

I love blogging even though it smells like a very old-schooled stuff. I love programming even though
I am not that young in this industry. To combine the two aspirations, writing stuffs regularly sounds
always right to me. To sharp your own knowledge there's no better way than teaching. You can teach via
blogging if there's no such student around.

This won't be all about tech, since I am also a reading guy and movie guy. Oh, that might sounds broad
and shallow you might think. I admit that's the case while I am stuggling to go deep while maintaining
my own interests. That sounds difficult for sure because we have work to do, kids to take care of, 
skills to  hone. That also brings the opportunity to lead to a good way of living the short life.

I always love *Robert Frost* and his famous poem: *The Road Not Taken*

```
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
```

Treading ahead is not easy for sure and whether the difference could be made is out of reach, while
I cannot regret with a *what if* ages later, so why not now?
