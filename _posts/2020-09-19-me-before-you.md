"Am I immune to the love story when I grow old?" absolutely not. Seems I am more vulnerable to romantic story now, and easier to weep when it doesn't end happily. The memory of watching the movie *Titanic* in a netbar years ago is still vivid, which the tears were trickling along my cheeks while other guys were playing CS and shouting loudly. I love the word *moved*, since at that moment, I was greatly *moved* and I couldn't sit still there, and the computer screen became vague like a drape before my eyes. The credits were scrolling and the music was singing around. I was deeply *moved*.

For this novel, it's easy to get an impression that it will end as a tragedy since the *quad* he is, and the disposition Lou has. Once their lives get intertwined, something surprising will turn up for sure. And then you know the 6-month period before the death, and you struggle with *Lou* to fight for the possible change. Initially I thought the author wouldn't execute the death sentence at last, and they could stay together with a difficult but happy life, but the author didn't. No one could change *Will*'s mind for a bit, even though everyone knows he did change regarding the life, while *it's not enough* to keep living, or he chose to *sacrifice* to allow *Lou* to have a more normal life of her own.

The suspense is haunting all the time, and we hold a reasonable hope to change *Will*. But we might not know that well, and we might put a wrong assumption, since we are not *quad*, and we don't have friends who are. We cannot imagine the life that is confined in a wheelchair and cannot make any decision by their own, esp. when there was such a wonderful life before that accident. Even when we don't have a colorful life as *Will*, we cannot imagine what we can do is to move a bit of our head, and say a bit, and suffer a lot with great care from others. Lucky you're rich, otherwise the miserable life will never cut you some slack.

As a class I watched in *master class*, the author teaches how to write a novel. He mentioned to bring up a controversial subject. Yes, *Jojo* did bring up a controversial one about whether choosing to die under great suffering is acceptable. I am a great life-lover, and I cannot imagine to get me killed in any situation, but I also fear of pains, physically and mentally. I know how it feels even though it might mean nothing comparing to the ones those desperate guys have to undertake. Hence, I never draw a conclusion to these topics, since you cannot be them, and you even cannot imagine.

Besides the tragedy, I love the two families. *Lou*'s family seems to be ordinary, but it's warm and good. Each member seems to be kind and interesting, which just reminds me of my parents. *Will*'s family is rich, but has its own issue. Maybe the marriage is not happy, but it's normal and understandable. *Will*'s father might be the one to have the affair, while we all know it's not that simple. His love to *Will* is genuine, so does to his new partner.

The reading is fun, since it's very easy and gripping at the same time. You won't feel tired and bored, and cannot put down the book since you want to know the outcome desperately.

I have to say such soup drama is entertaining and good to kill time. Maybe it can leave you something like the compassion to the disables or seniors, but it just seems to be a bit shallow and out of reach. It might be a good time to pick up a more serious book now.
