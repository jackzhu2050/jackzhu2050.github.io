It's been a long time since knowing this novel, while it was fasely assumed as
a children book since the start, which makes me to miss it for so long. Then
one day it was just in the reach of my hand on the shelf, and it was pulled out
and it amazed me.

It is not a children book, but it could arouse your interest like a child's
interest into a busy ant. The interest is pure and I was pulled constantly by
the possible obstacles over the course, even when I knew it would succeed and
the obstacles would be overcome.

The plot seems to be simple, which might make you think it will be
uninteresting, while as a classic, it surely deserves its reputation. Firstly,
for an novel about exploration, we all know Mr. Fogg would encounter a lot of
unforeseen things which could delay his journey, and he did. But the good part
of this to make it out of the "cliche" scope is that the author successfully
set up the obstacles with very convincing rationale, e.g in India, to save the
girl who would be sacrificed for her dead husband; in the US, they fought with the natives and he took
the time to find and rescue his servant; in Liverpool, Mr. Fogg was
arrested by the detective, etc.

Secondly, it's not just about exploration and it's more about human. We all
have the impression(from realworld or from books) to Englishmen for their lack of humor, their sternness.
And the author just pushes this into its extreme to have a character Mr. Fogg.
He is even more than an *Englishman* and be more interesting in his reputation than
the money, e.g for the wager, for the duel with the colonel. And then comes the
servant for his bravery and kindness, and the Indian girl for her growing love
towards Mr. Fogg, and the detective for his struggle to catch Mr. Fogg and the
changing attitude towards Mr. Fogg.

It's not a long and heavy one to read and I really enjoy the time reading it.
