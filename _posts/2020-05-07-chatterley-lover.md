When I was in high school, I loved reading so much, and picked up any books I could encounter and afford. I was very poor and besides the money spending on food, I had nearly nothing in my pocket, therefore I enjoyed reading in a little bookshop, or scanning through the books scattering on the ground by a seller. The owner of the bookshop would get angry if you didn't buy anything while only reading there for hours, which pushed me to the latter one for the most time. I loved so much reading there droopingly for an entire afternoon without knowing the external world around. Of course the books were mostly without copyright, and with very low quality, imagining very rough papers with characters on. And also they were really cheap, so for a poor student like me could afford to buy one or two a month.

*Lady Chatterley's Lover* was a very popular one on the ground. I was young and was in my adolescence full of hormones and energy. Looking at girls was like a beast with a great appetite. Nowhere to spend the energy, books with some *yellow* plots were the best entrance for the stirring heart. I still remembered clearly about how Lady Chatterley and the gamekeeper were in the rain naked, and put flowers over their naked bodies, which would easily redden my face and wet my pants. What I was reading and looking for were mostly those things that roused your imagination about such intimacy and thrill out of reach then.

This time is different, and it's been almost 20 years. There's no secret any longer between men and women for me. I can read the book with peace. I am amazed by the characters of the book, in which people care a lot about their minds and contemplate industrial culture and the effect of money. They think profoundly about the difference between physical intimacy and spiritual joy, which might turn out to be different from our opinions but might be more real in some way. I mean we might weigh the spiritual joy too much over physical intimacy, which if you think more and be honest, you might end up with a different answer. They care a lot about their innermost heart and desire with counting the reality, e.g social class, money, while they still pursue by following their hearts.

I am thinking about Sir Clifford. I don't know whether things would be different if he were not crippled. He might be impudent and contemptuous and despise the working class, and cannot stand any connection with them. But that might not be a single case but apply for most people in that class, esp. the cripple would surely worsen it. The book is mostly narrated by the perspective of Lady Chatterley, and we don't know too much about how Sir Clifford thinks and changes over the course, how much the cripple affects him, and the way he thinks about sex and the relationship with his wife. I really appreciate Sir Clifford's openness to allow his wife to have a kid with another man, which might be very normal in that age while it's not the case even for now. I do believe he even could allow lady Chatterley to own her lovers for the sex necessity to keep the relationship between even when it's not love.

I don't know whether physical intimacy is the foundation of love. It seems to be not necessary for someones. But for me, at least for now, I cannot imagine a couple of lovers without sex. In modern world, we think it's better to separate the love and sex, which you could access with different persons, and it's not necessarily be the same individual. Basically I agree with such separation as a better stage of society which is still not the case even for now, and is still remote in the coming decades. But I do hope it could become the norm in my lifetime. And maybe with that, Sir Clifford might be able to love Lady Chatterley and she could love back, while she could also maintain the physical relationship with the keeper.

I don't mean I hate the marriage between different classes, but I want to imagine a different ending which might show some sympathy to Sir Clifford.
