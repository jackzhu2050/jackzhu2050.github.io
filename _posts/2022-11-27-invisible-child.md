Children are the future, whether it will end up being a good one or a bad one. Children are always
the future of the world. It orignates how children are raised, and it ends up being the present state
of our society. Hence, instead of blaming the society, we might better reflect on how we raise our kids
which might be not too late yet.

Talking about children is not easy which you always have to talk about the family, their parents. When 
they have to move around to find shelters and switch schools for many times within a year, what we might 
be able to expect from them? That might be why a stable life for raising a kid is so important. Without a
stable life, incl. housing, food, schooling, is bad for the kids, without the presence of their parents is 
even worse, after the removal of the custody for some poor families.

Dasani is not a lucky girl, but she is so common and should be able to represent. She tried to be good, and
made some nice achievements in sports and schooling, but the tight-coupling family is always there to get her
distracted, because she is the biggest kid of the big family and she is more a mother sibling to other kids.
Choosing to fight or fly with good grades to gain the respect was not a difficult problem, because the former
one is always quick to approach to let your name known. And she has to protect her siblings.

Dasani is also lucky because of the author's frontpage report in New York Times which made her a celebrity to
gain some benefits immediately, e.g attending some political events, being enrolled to the Hershey, better life
condition, etc. But a year later, things became what it was and no one remembered her any longer. With some struggle
in Hershey, she was expelled later and sent back to Brooklyn, where her parents' custody was at the risk of being
removed. She might regret later about her expulsion, but was that all her fault? If there was no bad news from her
family, and if her parents were good, what might be different? 

At the end, surely there's no end, because Dasani and her family's life is still going, she was able to reunite with
her parents and several of her siblings, and she might have to move from shelters to shelters, but now she is adult
and she could use her life better.

The narrative is very vivid and detailed. At the first glance, I thought it was a novel, but over the course, the 
story and the characters just grew without too many colors and dramas, but the tough life and the daily struggles about
food and shelters are just there. Dasani's family is still in the hell, which the readers might quickly draw his or her
conclusion that the laziness and drug use caused the tragedy, but is that all? I think that's the key points the writer
wants to convey and provoke. Even for a country like the US, where individualism is the first principle for everyone, i.e
leave me alone and I have to take care of myself, should other forces play a role to make the condition better? Or is there
any hidden inequality haunting over the black's life?

Standing back a bit, I appreciate the writer and also a journalist's effort, which lasted for years with a very
careful disinterested standpoint(or at least she tries to keep at that position), and also looked up so many archives
to know the bigger picture in the history's perspective. Therefore, the outcome is stunning and remarkable. After reading it, 
many will disagree, but they also know the life of that family and the history of the tragedy, that's very important because
now we know each other and won't shout at each other without any ground. That's a very important step to reach a better
state for those similar families, for a better society, and more importantly for those invisible children, who shapes our
future.
