Walking towards the stage without trembling in his body.

Stepping behind the podium steadily. 

The man with white hair, at the age of 81, started to tell his story.

"I used to work in the basement stockroom but couldn't remember where anything went. One day, I told the owner."

"'I want to study mathematics in MIT.'"

"And the owner bursted in to laughter and believed nothing about it."

Jim managed to go to MIT, and he managed to achieve a lot of stuffs we cannot even imagine to be possible. 

He made a great success as a mathematician by tackling geometry problems, and earned a prestigious award in the field. He then helped create the math department of a university by attracting a bunch of famous mathematicians. 

After academic life, he went to finance and investment by employing his math insights. Discovering signals from the massive data sets, identifying the patterns of commodity and stock prices trend, building models to utilize these confirmed signals and patterns, he was able to create a great deal of wealth in his life. The return of investment is so large, which overshadows other legendary investors like George Soros, Ray Dalio, or even Warren Buffet.

How to spend the money wisely haunted him when his wealth grew like a rocket. He created the Simons Foundation which supports projects related to education and health. He also sponsored projects exploring the birth of the universe. He donated a lot of money on the researches of cure to autism disorder. The list can be longer. And these activities made him also a philanthropist.

*The Man Who Solved the Market* by *Gregory Zuckerman* is very riveting, esp. the petty things was written in detail to let you know how the great person grew to who he is now. But to be fair, the story is a bit distracting from its subject to put too many inks on other people instead of Jim. We might expect more on Jim from the title while we cannot be satisfied, at least I cannot. Otherwise, another title might be a better fit.

Jim made frequent career switching, not once but three time. We might wonder what is behind these decisions. The reasons should be strong not just speculating, while the book also failed in this perspective. I always believe there's something deep to motivate a person to make a huge decision, and exploring that cause and giving a better narrative will surely justify a good book.

The author acknowledged he is not professional in finance and investment, and that's true, which makes the book more a fantasy to read, not a book to gain insights about investment. I believe the book could be better if the author himself were a quant or an investor or even better an investment veteran. Swinging between efficient market(nobody could exploit the market by any way) and efficiency of model based trading makes the readers roll their eyes since the author just picked the one to justify his then narratives.

Reading as a fantasy of a great investor might be a better pose. And the readers could gain a different understanding about what humans can achieve in their short lives. And Jim Simons's insights could also be helpful but not that practical to apply.

Standing behind the podium, his voice was steady. He also told jokes to spark laughters in the audience including his wife. The couple lost two sons when they were still young. The length or even the achievement might be not the correct measurement to life, but what could be? At the end, we might prefer a peaceful life with family around happily and there's a small study we can read the books we really enjoy. We can see a serene mountain or a calm sea not far, which will be surely a plus.
