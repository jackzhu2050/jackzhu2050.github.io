There is no doubt that *Harry Potter* is the most well-known character in the world and the most interesting thing is that kids are even more enthusiastic about it, which allows me to talk with my daughter about this shared interest repeatedly with a lot of laughter and the wonder towards this magic world.

It is so popular so when I read it now in books, I seem like a wizard who knows a lot in advance about how the story get unfolded, till this 3rd book. Now I could follow the story with suspense hanging high and enjoy guessing what might come next. My daughter poked me for too many times about what happens in the 3rd book, while I have kept the secret so far without spoiling the plot. And I hope one day soon she could pick up the book herself and enjoy it fully.

Spoiler Alert! Don't read if you haven't read the book.

So it comes to the 3rd book of Harry Potter, who has grown to 13 years old. The unchanged miserable life in his aunt's house, the Quidditch match, the unchanged Malfoy, etc are still the elements we expect to stay and they do stay. The new elements I love most is the more information about Harry Potter's father James. We don't know so much about him but only his great sacrifice when fighting Voldemort. Now we have teacher *Lupin* who was the friend of James, and he could demystify a bit about Harry's father. Of course, James was not a *good* student who always followed rules exactly, but just like *Harry*, he was curious about everything and messed around here and there in the castle and loved adventure. And even better, James was also a wonderful *seeker* of Quidditch.

Lupin said in the book, "I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle."

I am genuinely happy that I am interested in a lot of things and enjoy playing around. And I think that's the most important merit of humankind. Curiosity leads us to find new things, to do things in a different way, to create and innovate and invent. We are drowned in the sea of information and the repeated mundane things. We don't have time to examine us, and we don't have time to follow our curiosity. We grow older and we go farther away from being a real human. That's why I love this part so much and I guess that's also why so many people like *Harry*.

Then *J.K Rowling* introduced a new magic stuff *Time Turner* besides the *Invisible Cloak*. With it, *Hermione* managed to take several courses at the same time which makes a wonderful preparation, and later she and Harry managed to save the two lives. While time travel is not new at all, and for the most time, it's tricky to make it right due to the *grandfather paradox*; *J.K Rowling*'s setting is even more crude and the only explanation about you cannot meet the other you in face is to avoid driving him crazy and insane, which I don't like. But I guess kids will buy it and love it, which my daughter thinks it smart.

I hope I can read more about *Harry*'s parents in the next books, and maybe my daughter could join my reading very soon.
