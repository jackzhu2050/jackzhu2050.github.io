I cannot clearly remembered which year it was when I went to a theater with my wife at a deep night to watch one of the *Harry Potter* movies in Beijing. We were sitting at the 1st row and the rightmost seats, which made it a less pleasant experience. But it's still a cherished memory I always think of. One reason is that it was a sweet night for me and my then girlfriend and also the movies was good and we talked about it on the way home.

*Harry Potter* might be assumed as a kids' book, which might be true, but I enjoy it a lot too. I have a box of Harry Potter books on my shelf, which seem to be easy to identify and pick up. Therefore, I start reading it now.

Hero's stories are everywhere and turn up now and then. And like *Hero's journey*, the path to become a hero seems to be similar which even we can identify a pattern. *Harry Potter* is not an exception, but with a different setting, i.e magic world. As a kid, we like daydreaming a lot of *what if I were a* kinda things, and we love magic so much. My daughter has a case which holds several simple instruments which could play and make her be a magician. She enjoys playing such magics to my nephew -- a little boy -- and each time, we can hear the unceasing giggles even when she has already played to him for many times.

Years ago, when my daughter was very little, I used to tell the stories of *Harry Potter* to her while we walk together along the road. And I made the stories short in sections and she always asked me to tell more. And it stopped for some reason I couldn't remember, but the story wasn't fully told due to her primary school life and my out-of-stock of the story.

The first book leads us to a magic world with some interesting settings, e.g the soccer-like sport, the different schools, the dark forest, the great hall, the interesting people, the friendship, etc. Along the story, a lot of questions emerge and haunt you, and the suspense pushes you ahead. It's not like a traditional children books and it has a lot of well-crafted suspense and thrilling elements, which make it more exciting to read. It might be a bit darkish while the friendship among the three kids, Harry's aunt and uncle, Hagrid and his warm-hearted temperament make a good balance. The adventure and exploring by the three kids unfold something big and dark behind the normal and peaceful school life. So it becomes more gripping and thrilling while reading it and thank *J.K. Rowling* for her wonderful way of arranging the stories.

Look forward to *the Chamber of Secrets*.
