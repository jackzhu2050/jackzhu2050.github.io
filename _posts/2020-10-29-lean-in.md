I was a bit hesitating when I try to add the *tags* for this post, since I wanted to put *feminism* but I used *female* instead. Just as *Sheryl Sandberg* mentioned in the book *Lean In*, that word might be misleading and convey the wrong information at least for now.

As a male who lives in China, gender equality is better than some countries, but it's never close to perfect. If we look around, we'll notice so much inequality everywhere. You could barely see a female leader in all the public companies, and it's worse if we meant the C titles. You could encounter more females street janitors than males for sure(I don't mean the job is not respectful but it pays less and works long). And last night, when we were having dinner and watching the nightly news, I raised a question about a piece of news that there was no female on the stage in the opening ceremony of a project. My wife said nothing. My daughter asked why and I gave a quick reply stressing inequality. And we moved on.

In recent years, we could hear a lot about women's rights movements, e.g *Me too*, *fair pay*, etc. They're obviously serious issues in our society and I am excited to see the impact it could introduce and I expect to see the tangible changes subsequently. Just as *Sheryl* put in the book, it needs generations' endeavor and requires also the males' commitments. Watching my daughter's growing, I can clearly find out she is more clever than the then myself, and I am always moved by her crazy but exciting thoughts and curiosities about everything around. She is full of questions. She is still very young, and over the course of her growing up, I really don't want her to be treated unfairly not because of her merits but her gender. However, I still highly doubt she could earn the same equality as her male peers in the coming years.

It's not just about our society or the bias from males, but it's also about females themselves. In my life, I've met a lot of fabulous women who are so smart and humorous and intelligent, and I always feel with great gratitude to be friends with them. And also I met a lot of females who are not confident or even hostile to other females with great disdain, and they talked them with the same gender badly on public or private occasions. They don't think those female peers over them deserve that position or are competent in that title, while they have less hostility or disdain towards their male superiors. This problem embedded deeply in their heart is even more dangerous, since sometimes the society weighs that more when it comes from the same gender. But why does this happen? It's about the long-time culture in our society, and the education we've received since we're very young, or even from the family rearing. The hints about what a woman should do are subtle but powerful in our daily classrooms, on our dining tables, in the small talks with friends, which consolidates that *mainstream* culture regarding women.

*Lean In* sheds a lot of light on these situations mentioned above with a lot of inspiring examples, and the better parts are its candor and openness and directness regarding these female issues. Such *counter-culture* book requires a lot of courage to write and it might bring some bad effect to the author's career path for sure, while *Sheryl* is absolutely the right person with exact qualification for this book talking this topic, since she is successful and could be a role model to other females. One thing I feel a bit awkward while reading the book is that *Sheryl* mentioned her nervousness several times when trying to battle against the stereotyped career environments, whether it's her maternity leave or her requirement for a pregnant parking lot, etc. That I feel a bit awkward and sad is because something which seems valid and proper is not there or it's only on paper, and you have to fight for the real ones.

Just before ending this post, I did a bit google about *Marissa Mayer*, who was the CEO of Yahoo for 5 years, and was regarded as the worst CEO ever. I don't like such a claim, and I don't think it's fair. Back to the starting year for *Marissa*, the trend was going down for Yahoo, and it was really hard to catch up with the then Google or other great companies. It's not necessary to prove she is a bad CEO or females are not good at C titles in an even broader view. If we go through all the males with C titles, we might see more failures, and that is unfair to conclude for females after one example of failure, or maybe it's not even a failure.
