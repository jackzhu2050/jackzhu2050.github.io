After Doctor King, whoever says *I have a dream* is like plagiarism, or cliche. However, who does not have a dream? Whether it's significant or trivial, we are striving for that day and night. A dream is like a lighthouse, glimmering remotely, and even sometimes it becomes completely dark, but we know it is there, and we know it's reachable.

Back to my dream, it's a specific lifestyle. A study full of good books must be cozy, with a window facing the sun, or sometimes a breeze, also with a big table, where I could put a bunch of books to allow me to grope around now and then. There should also be a coffee machine nearby, which I could make a coffee as I like to enjoy the reading with a decent coffee. A dog or a cat can crawl around sometimes, and jump over my table playing with me, or ask for a touch. The study must be quiet, so I can read without any outside interference. Bedrooms or living rooms or dining rooms are not that much to me. 

So I am talking about houses. Yes,  I am thinking about my senior life years later. For now, my apartment is cozy but very small, and the small study is almost overflowed, where books are even laying on the floor. 

Therefore, we went to a district in the north of Xi'an, and visited a bunch of real estates. Most houses are good and could meet my requirements, while they are too distant, and driving made me crazy. Besides, the sun was so hot, and we were all sweating so much, not to mention the masks that we had to wear all the time. But, I love that place after visiting, for its spacious neighborhood, and the nearby parks, and also the subways. It seems to be a good fit except for the price, which makes this a dream from reality.

It's indeed like a lighthouse pointing the direction that you need to sail for. Until we reach that, we can give a relief breath, and enjoy that moment with everything you dreamed for.
