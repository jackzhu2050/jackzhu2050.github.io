There is a category of books that we call them as *self-help* or in China we call them as *chicken soup*. They always occupy a large chunk of a bookshop, in a very prominent position, very colorful and always with a catchy title. And the content is also similar by stating a bunch of advice that are obviously correct or even well-known by any reader. Each section might have a catchy sentence to remind you, to provoke you, to push you, and a story will follow which occupies the most space of the section. What could be the takeaway after reading such books, is the catchy, obvious but hard to apply tips in the table of contents, which you will forget very soon or in a week after several failing trials.

This category mostly covers the self-improvement on procrastination, marriage, parenting, etc. And also it tells stories about so-called *successful* businessman which makes an illusion for you to be able to copy their success by following their path. And the tips are almost always very vague which you couldn't follow and apply to yourself and you will end up being with nothing improved and you cannot blame anyone but yourself by not following the advice exactly.

Therefore, I always look down this category of book and don't want to read a word of it.

Then it comes to this book *The Passionate Programmer*. I didn't realize it belongs to this category at first, and I read the preface which the authors tries to build a connection between his book and the famous *The Pragmatic Programmer*. And he succeeded to impress me by his passion and I started reading this book.

Like any other *self-help* *chicken soup*, the tips in this book are nothing new but some well-known advice, e.g you should care more about the business, you should hone your skills, you should not stay at your comfort-zone, you should contribute to open source projects to make you known, you should re-assess the trend of the technology and try to adopt early, you should start small and improve daily, you should stress the quality of the software, etc. And in short, you should be passionate to become outstanding.

They are all known to me before reading the book, so it teaches me nothing new. Maybe the only thing which seems interesting is the author's career path. He used to be a musician and then quit to become a programmer, and seems to be successful in this career, and now he has a book about *programming* (maybe it's not). For most of us, we learn computer sciences for years and develop software in the industry for years, and then try to pick up some instruments, which seems to be a reverse path comparing to the author's. And I think it's an interesting contrary, and I cannot agree more that passion is the key to success. (while obviously it's not from this book).
