I thought I have all the good books that I could buy in market in English. But obviously 
I was wrong. I miserably missed this great book, which is surely a classic. Encountering it was 
also an accident, when I skimmed around in the library at the English language section. Of course
most books are for English learning, and very few books in English which are published in China.
I picked one which I even couldn't find the printing information on its pages, but I love its title 
immediately and took it with me. Then the reading started very quickly and I loved it. I felt like buying
one copy for myself, and I did buy a second-hand one and switched to this book where I could scribble as I want
and draw as I like.

It's not an easy-reading book and it dug deep into the human beings. Basically there are two groups of people
around me. One group is the ones that they know and another group is the one they don't know. *Know* yourself, *know*
the surroundings, *know* what and why, and the most important one is to *know* yourself. Surely it's hard but once
you start the journey, you cannot get back to the state that you don't *know*. *Loneliness* is something you have to
confront now and then repeatedly. We have friends and family around us, while we have to confront ourselves when
the night is deep and the darkness is around. "What is the meaning?" "Does it mean anything at all about what I do
everyday?" "Who am I?" And then we just feel lost and lonely, because the friends and family seem distant and no longer
be friends and family that we expect them to be, i.e _understanding_ . We want to find some place to be alone and 
to get immersed into a strange place. We want to belong to some group of folks and expect they could _understand_ us more
and surely that's almost in vain and ends up with more sorrow and disappointment. No matter which group you belong to, 
loneliness is something you couldn't get around easily. And once it comes, you struggle and you fight back, or you just
submit and surrender.

Loneliness is so overwhelming, which makes a true friendship become even more important and precious. Something too good to lose.
While not everyone owns such friendship, that's surely a pity, but once you do have it, how could you live with it well?
Mr. Singer is a nice gentleman for sure, and he is lucky enough to have a real friend which he cherishes so much. And once 
the friend is gone, he had to suicide to be able to skip the looming endless loneliness ahead. At the meantime, he inadvertently 
becomes the real friend to several other characters, e.g the colored doctor Copeland, the little girl Mick, the wanderer Jake, the
cafe owner Biff. They cherish the friendship between Singer and themselves even though Singer is a mute and couldn't respond too much.
How could they live without him? 

"Nothing had happened except that he had made a friend and lost him."

"The store, then home to sleep, and back at the store again."

We are all confused and know nothing about choice. We blindly make a choice, and we live with it and we regret. The cycle just repeats
and enforces itself. Each cycle just makes us more helpless and tightens the grip of fate and destiny. 

"But was this flight or was it onslaught?"

That struggle goes on and we are still the hunter for a difference.
