Some famous books might go disappointing after reading while some will exceed your expectation. *The long goodbye* belongs to the latter group for me. It's been a long time to have a book that made me feel so different and was infused with suspense, love, deep emotion, which are so well conveyed using the witty words. And it becomes naturally gripping and keeps me intrigued till the end.

Mrs. Wades might be just more like a sexy attraction as the first impression, while she grows to be more complex and fascinating while the plot evolves and discloses gradually. She holds the love deeply and plans carefully, and executes wisely. But she might underestimate the private detective to lead the unexpected outcome. The love to *Lennox* is so deep and heavy that it's hard to bear the jealousy a bit. And then the haunting knowledge by her husband made her step further. The two murders might seem to be grisly and made her like a monster in some way, but it becomes justified if we count the love. And that night Mr. Marlowe(the PD) was mistaken to be another man, which might also remind us about her love.

Then the family behind the murdered lady is also haunting there all the time. The power is tangible in every way around. And her sister Mrs. Loring is also an interesting person. The implicit binding between the PD and Mrs. Loring is there even without telling out explicitly until the day before Mrs. Loring set about to Paris to get divorced. Sometimes we could feel a binding from where you love to go, what books you like to read, how you put things, etc.

And Mr. Lennox, which is fading to the background after very few chapters of the book, but he stands strongly and persistently there. We know what type of person he is like, and we feel his elegance. The suspense of his death is overshadowing the whole story from that point on. Like the PD, we cannot easily buy the suicide and the confession letter. And in the end, he turns up again, still elegant and with his morality, while things are completely different now after more persons died. He is a bit indifferent, and might push us away from him a little, while we might still wonder how he might feel with the message of Mrs. Wades's death.

The PD *Mr. Marlowe* is not just professional but also interesting. It's not like a person that only cares his own business without any compassion being put in. That's why he is such an interesting person with his own morality, and makes him stubborn and persistent to find out the truth beneath. He is not a sage or monk with an insuperable moral standard but more an ordinary person with many desires, like money and sex. He is also sensitive to his surroundings, and has his own view to the world, the love and human beings. He is wise and intelligent. And he likes digging the truth.

There're so many characters who are so glistening and shining, and you cannot help liking them. With the author's smart way to put the plot, we cannot drop the book at all till we give a relieved sigh or a slight reluctance to the end when finishing the last page.

In some ways, Higashino Keigo's books are like this one for its sophisticated arrangement of the characters and plots, esp. the suspense and the final disclosure of the truth, while the book is much earlier, which should be able to speak itself loudly.
