Project management is very difficult, which is even more true for software project management. The reason is not unobvious. People are heavily involved in the whole process, from product designing, to implementing by coding, until deployment to the end-users. The process is long and closely interdependent, and each small change might affect all in a significant way. Therefore, decades of time has passed since people started exploring how to improve the process, and we've made some progress by mimicking the project management in the manufacturing industry to proposing the new software-industry-specific practices. It's not always straight upward, but more an upward spiral, e.g we learned the waterfall model decades ago by mimicking, and we learned the lean development also by mimicking Toyota's system.

The biggest lesson we've learned and the essential thing everyone agrees is that the team must evolve in accord with the nature of change in software projects. Bearing the change in mind, we have the Agile to embrace the changes; we have the DevOps to reduce the delivery lead time to make the feedback cycle short; we have the lean development to amplify learning to become a generative team to be able to create better ideas to better serve our customers. In short, we want to move faster in each phase of the process.

Then it comes to the culture change. Traditionally we follow *Adam Smith*'s division of labor. In software development, it means to devide the engineers to different groups, and typically we have front-end engineers, back-end engineers, system admistrators, database administrators, testers, etc. And each group just takes care of the responsibilities under their role, e.g backend-end engineers won't do the deployment or database tuning, etc. In some way, it's good, e.g the ones with specific expertise could do better in their domain, each member could become deeper instead of wider, it's supposed to be faster. But with the advent of DevOps movement, the distinction between development and operation blurs, and Dev is expected to know Ops, while Ops is required to Dev. It is arguably better to be able to: everything is in code(e.g configuration as code), more back-ups when things fail, not just deeper but also wider, faster since Dev is requied to be able to deploy.

After years' practice of DevOps, it is proved to be a good way to react faster for customers' feedback. And then the authors wrote this book by systemazing DevOps and measuring the impact in a quantitative way to the company, the developers, and also the customers. They employed the *survey* as the main methodology and justified its validity for the conclusion they claim. For this part, I am prone to doubting the methodology but I am postive to its claim. In some way, *survey* might be the only viable approach for this problem due to the nature of the problem.

They try to measure the performance in different metrics, incl. delivery lead time, deployment frequency, time to restore service, change fail rate. These metrics are important to measure the performance of a development team. To boost the performance, the authors also claim to have some important supportive environment, incl. comprehensive documentations, company culture(esp. the learn from failure). That is really a pain for some real-world practices, where they also apply the DevOps practice and expect every Dev to know the details about Ops, but there're no such supportive documentations, which could discourage the engineers in a bad way, and also slow things down.

Therefore, it's not always a change in its surface, e.g changing the motto, or announcing it in the all-hands meeting. But it takes time to mimick other mature practice and then evlove based on the team, and finally figure out the approach that fits the team best. That might be a mixture of different models, but it must align with every member's interst and way of doing things productively.

At the end, the authors gave a case study of ING Netherlands, which is a good resource to learn from. It is a big company with thousands of developers, but its way of organizing the whole company is inspiring, e.g Tribe -> Squad in the vertical line, and chapter crosing squads in the horizontal line, which could enable the knowledge sharing using *chapter*, and the close collaboration within a squad, and a high level achievement within a tribe. I heard this structure firstly from *Spotify*, not ING. I don't know which company is first, but the whole idea is a very interesting and inspiring one, esp. for a company in a certain scale. (Therefore, not that practical for a small start-up.)

To draw the end to this article, I appreciate the book for its somehow quantative way of measuring the impact of DevOps, and it's kind of systematic way of summarizing the practice of DevOps. The justification might not be strong enough, but the conclusion still could stand firmly, even when we accept it as a qualitative analysis. At least we all agree to react faster, deliver faster to survive and prosper in the fast-changing software engineering industry.
