After reading [Tom Sawyer](2020-04-22-tom-sawyer.md), Huck Finn continues my reading journey. Not like Tom Sawyer, who is more adventurous and more style-pursuing without considering others too much -- but as a little boy what more we could expect -- Huck Finn seems more normal, kind. His own adventures without Tom are also more uneven, like a thrilling road movie.

His friendship with Jim(the black man), and interaction with the *king* and the *duke* are all very interesting. The ways they defraud people to give a speech to gather voluntary money, to play as a dead person's brother to cheat the whole family and even the whole village for the inheritance, are all very fascinating. They ended up badly as expected. And Huck plays as Tom at Tom's auntie while Tom plays Sip to free Jim who has already been freed by the owner's will. Tom is so obsessed with style following the books he's read, and contrives a very complex and styled skip plan for Jim, which they have to add the extra difficulties to make the skip look more heroic. And it didn't turn out as expected and Tom got shot which even thrilled him more, and it added more flavor to his adventure. With Tom's another auntie's coming everything is clear, and the two boys and also Jim got a very happy ending.

Then comes to my favorite part of the story, i.e the staying with his father in a locked cabin. Huck's father is a drunkard and never gives up any chance to make money legally or with fraud. He tries his best to get the money that Huck and Tom found as a treasure and hijacks Huck to that small cabin. The way his father treats him, and how he tries to escape all seem intriguing to me. I don't have the experience with such a bad parent in my life, and I don't understand why this brutal treatment to their kids could take place. And finally Huck managed to escape and disguised a murdering scene to stop the further trouble from his father.

Huck is a more interesting character to me. He is more wild comparing to Tom and is not *civilized* in some way due to the missing care from his early dead mother. On one hand he expects loves and cares from people, but he cannot stand the strick discipline he has to follow and prefers a more wild life as before on the other. So he stuggles a lot over the course and escapes to adventure instead. We might expect he could end up being a *civilized* obedient rightous person finally after he was adopted by Tom's auntie at the end.

Mark Twain is a fantastic master of writing who could put the story so well. I expect to read more from him.
