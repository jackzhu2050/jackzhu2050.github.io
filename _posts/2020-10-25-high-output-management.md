The presence of Intel in China is not significant, and it only left me an impression when I was in college for my master's degree. Intel's building is near to my campus, and for several times, I passed by it with a close staring at its famous logo on the building. And then the famous sound of its ads, and its logos in every laptop, etc. But as a tech company with outstanding management, it never comes across my mind until not long ago.

In *John Doerr*'s awesome book [Measure what matters](2020-10-13-measure-what-matters.md), the author made a lot of quotes or methodology from *Andrew Grove*, whom I've heard of but never had the chance to know more. *John*'s stress on *OKR* and attributes it to *Andrew*, which elicits me to read more about *Andrew*.

And it naturally comes to the *old* book *High Output Management*. It's not a typical management book -- which typically is long and superficial, and never covers the specific and you cannot apply, and even the worse, the title normally is the only thing you need to know --, it covers a lot of specifics in detail, and discusses in context with real daily work, and it could be easily applied in similar situations the readers encounter every day. And it's concise, and easy to read, or fun to read. It's also very frank, even though readers might feel a bit uncomfortable for his directness and sole focus on the high output. How to handle the relationship between supervisors and subordinates also depends on whether the supervisor could give an objective review, which seems to be blunt.

Readers might feel a bit blunt or uncomfortable during the reading, but at the same time, he nods a lot and it allows you to reflect about your past similar experiences. It might feel not very humane but it just hits the point, and it exactly and accurately delivers what it is supposed to deliver as its title states.

Before reading books like this, I've got a long-time belief that *it's impossible to measure the output of an intellectual worker*. The arguments are obvious and easy to imagine. Until recently after reading some books about this topic, I realized it might be *difficult* but never *impossible* to measure, or maybe not *measure* but *elicit the peek performance/output* as *Andrew* put it. As a manager, we must switch an angle of the management to focus on how to improve the output of the whole team, not only focus on your own. To achieve the goal of maximizing your team's output, we could do a lot of things, e.g use leverage(training, bonus, promotion, etc), weekly one-on-one meetings(keep the high morale), OKR, monitoring(dual reporting, also the task-relevant maturity to decide how to manage), review process(make the review and deliver it), managing an interview or a quitting, etc.

Though those things might seem to be more subjective, and there's no step-by-step how-to guideline, esp. in detail, they're still very relevant and helpful. We all know we're human beings and we have a lot of inherent flaws and also merits, which allows the managers to utilize the knowledge about human and psychology to boost his subordinates' performance, and eventually contributes to the overall goal of the company.

I am very often surprised by how detailed and specific by *Andrew*'s ways of doing things in management, esp. the rationale underneath, which makes everything easy to understand and follow, esp. if we check the history of *Intel*, and see how the company performs during *Andrew*'s time, we'll be more respectful for this old man.

This is a book I will place on my computer table all the time, and it is very rewarding to read it here and there, now and then.
