*Time* is a very wonderful and intriguing thing. It's one-directional, and past is always passed. So we try to alleviate it using our recollection, in which time could go wherever it wants. And we put weights on the time we shared with people. On one hand, the time becomes memory which we could easily pick up again by talking with our old friends or looking at the yellow photos(or with our blurred eyesight). On the other hand, the people become closer and more important to us. Our regret is useless and we become more careful and cautious when we grow old. But we gradually realize regrets are inevitable and we always lose, and we become even more cautious and hesitant and conservative. We watch our kids grow and we are eager to give advice since we don't want them to be hurt, but the response might be not friendly, and they think you put too much constraints over them. So the peace is hard to maintain, and they might prefer going to another city for college instead of staying beside you. Then only you and your partner and your memory. Laugh doesn't come from something new, but always from the memory, esp. you'll always smile when you look at your kid's 3-year-old innocent expression. And finally it comes to an end, which is the best for the time, and it makes everyone equal at that point. Everyone will die which makes the change and progress possible.

What we used to believe very important will fade away and any hardship can be laughed away. Seems like a long period of time or a great effort will eventually condense into several words, e.g *the bittersweet of my first love*, *the exhaustion of high school*, etc. Those words are too vague and big, and they're far from what we've really experienced, but it's a pity that they're what we only have now. The farther the memory is, the fewer the words, and the more vague the words. Or sometimes we might remember how emotional we were which might involve cry, screaming, depression, etc. Still those emotions cannot enliven those old memories too much. Just like a hallowed object, the essential part is missing.

Therefore, time is ruthless and importance can change. *What did you expect?* Just as *Stoner* asked him repeatedly at the end of his life. Everyone will think about *what if* like alternatives in the important stops of our life journey. What if I met a *Ms Right*? You could talk more and share more and understand more. She might be ideally an exact copy of yourself but with a different gender. What if I loved her more? we might be able to manage a much better relationship. Some fighting might have been avoided. What if I had another career, e.g as a writer? It doesn't mean you'll be successful and more probably you'll be a nobody and your words are just some words no one will bother reading. But would I be happier? More probably you might be less happier due to the money issue.

*Stoner* touched his book gently which might make him immortal, just like *Stoner* makes *John Williams* immortal. Something important and immortal will always be there even after your death. But as a very ordinary person, what is our option? We might not be able to be immortal, and of course not everyone dreams of that. We still try to find the meaning of our life, and want to have some *legacy* even when it's just for your family, or your school, or your neighborhood, or your community. So we might have things to do.

Lying on the small bed of his study, *Stoner* saw several university students walk across his lawn. The youth is obvious and stunning like sunlight. He might have remembered his early life in the farm, his study life in the university and doing chores for his aunt, his beloved teacher, his best friend who went to war and died, his first meeting with Edith, his daughter Grace, the lifelong fight with *Lomax*, his dear *Katherine*, and his another lifelong friend *Finch*.

Is *Stoner*'s life a good one? *good* might seem too subjective, but I have to admit he led a very meaningful life, and he did two huge things most people wouldn't have the courage to do. The first thing is that he had his true love *Katherine*. Each time I imagine how wonderful it is when you could sit with your beloved in the same room and be able to immerse yourself in your work and have a good discussion with your partner in pure intelligence and knowledge. Of course, the intimacy in flesh is also a bless. The second thing is that he didn't compromise with his code of ethics when confronting with *Lomax*, even though the revenge was very awful and lasted for very long, but he didn't regret it. So, as an ordinary person, are you brave enough to pursue your true love? And can you stay head up when confronting with someone bigger and powerful than you who might destroy your career?

I love this book very much.
