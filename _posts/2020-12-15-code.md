Majoring in *Computer Science* (even though *Hal Abelson* argued it is not a *science*), you'll definitely learn something about how *a computer works*, and you will pick up some ideas about *bit*, byte, gates, RAM, CPU, stack, etc. And you might gain a vague understanding about how a computer boots and loads the instructions to its RAM and starts to execute. As the time elapses, the impression will become very blurring, even when we write code every day.

As a programmer(or *coder*), the site *StackOverflow* is like heaven which even beats the porn sites as the must-go site daily or even hourly. And you won't forget the long list of must-reads like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read) or [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list). And *Charles Petzold*'s *Code* will always be there.

*Code* is not a new book, which was published in 1999, and since then a lot of things happened in the computer industry, esp. the advent of mobile devices, which is inevitable but still significant. Not like a typical textbook, the author starts with a story about two little kids who try to communicate with each other in the dark nights. That's a wonderful entry point which reminds me a lot about myself. It covers the history of long-distance communication e.g Morse Code, telegraphy, telephone, etc. And then it covers the origin of counting, binary, and also the old computing equipment, and how to build the computer from the small gates until finally we could build a rudimentary *computer* and the whole process is eye-opening.

I love how the author organizes this book and how he teaches in a step-by-step approach by building upon small components gradually without requiring too much sophisticated prior knowledge. When it comes to the end as you could build a *computer*, that's really *something*, and that's a great reward without too much struggling.

*Charles Petzold* is a wonderful author, and [his blog](https://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/) is also interesting with his small thoughts. He is writing a book with the name *Computer of the Tides: Lord Kelvin's Machine to Disprove Evolution* which I am highly expecting.
