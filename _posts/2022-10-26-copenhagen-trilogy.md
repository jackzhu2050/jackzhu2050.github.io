I am trying to build a morning route, when I could have my own time to do
something I want. And the route now shows itself as reading books, with one as
English and one as Chinese. That works well by far, and every morning, with a
hot coffee by the left hand, I sit at the table with the book and enjoy that
wonderful time.

I heard of this book before, but didn't know what it is about, and maybe one
important fact about it is that it appeared in the NYT's book list. So facing a
brand-new book without any prior knowledge, it's like an adventure in an
unknown place. Over the course, it might get you lost, and it also could stun
you with splendid views you couldn't imagine otherwise, and you might spot
something mundane which you could connect to yourself, and you might start to
think about yourself, about the deep questions we all dodge everyday.

It is about a girl, her childhood, her youth, and her dependency. 

When she was
young, the life seemed to be miserable, when his father was unemployed and they
could only live on welfare, and also she couldn't go to the high school even
though she was gifted and wanted to do that. The relationship was odd with her
parents and her brother. She was not allowed to be ambitious to become a
writer, or poet, even though her father read books and talked politics. Her mother was more
worldly and cared nothing about spirit or soul. She was ugly, so she always
lived in a way that she was compared to her handsome brother and was laughed at.

When she grew old, and left the school to start work, she kept his dream to
become a writer and tried to write poems and sent several to an editor. The
editor didn't dislike them but claimed the poems were too childish, and wanted
her to come back years later. She was not discouraged by this rejection, but kept
writing, until one day she read the obituary of that editor at his father's newspaper. The
world seemed to collapse in front of her and her dream was shattered. After
changing several jobs, she went to pubs with her friend and finally was able to
contact another editor *Moller*, who became her first husband later. He was
able to help her publish her poems and also her first novel, but he was much
older than her and she couldn't feel any passion about this relationship.

She gained the fame after publishing some of her works, and then met a college
student *Ebbe*, who became her second husband. They had a daughter *Helle*, but
felt a horrible distance when she was pregnant and gave birth. So when she was
pregnant again, she tried to abort and met a doctor *Carl* who became her third
husband later. *Carl* used some addictive shots and pills upon her and she
became **dependent** on him and to get the drugs, she divorced *Ebbe* and
married *Carl* and moved together. With the use of more drugs, she became more
and more addictive and to get the shots, she submitted to him completed and
stayed away with her old friends and writing. Until one day she mustered up all
her courage to call another doctor and got admitted to the rehab. After the
suffering in the rehab, she got divorced with *Carl* and moved back to her
apartment, but she faked the prescription to use the drugs again. Later, she
met her fourth husband *Victor* and moved to the country from Copenhagen to live
a peaceful life which also made the access to drugs unable.

While I was reading the book, I thought it was a novel to show a girl's
dramatic life. And the author tried to make it feel like real by giving some
mundane details and also some dramatic elements to grip your attention. But
when I know it's a non-fiction after looking up, it overwhelmed me greatly for
its details and vivid feeling, esp. it's like you who was going through those
sufferings with *Carl* and later in the rehab. It's also hard for me to imagine
how life was in Denmark 70 years ago.

The trilogy was finished in 1960s and it's been so far away from now. But when
I read it, seems I was there and could watch and live the similar life, but
couldn't do anything else. Maybe it was just that period, and maybe it's always
like that. Nothing we could do about life.
