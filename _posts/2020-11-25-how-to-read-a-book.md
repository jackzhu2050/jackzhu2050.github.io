I have to admit that reading this book is not easy, and it's very challenging in two different senses. First, it's very slow, which just reminds me of my college life when preparing for the final exam. Second, it just blows me off, since I read books every day, but I always like *reading in quantity, but not in quality*, which makes me feel sorry. But it is also a wonderful experience, and it's like walking on a line in the air, where you could see beautiful scenes around you, but the destination is even more interesting, which is the entrance to something big.

I think every serious reader must have heard and read this book before, and me not an exception. But I cannot remember so much about the previous reading, and neither the content. Sometimes you are daydreaming and your mind is flying around even when you are reading or listening to something really important, and at the end, you check and reward you with a *completed* tag attached, which is like a prize you could show around, but as a truth, you don't improve for a bit. That's what *Adler* stresses in the book as *active reading*. We cannot passively wait for the knowledge by seeing the words and turning the pages without using our minds to think through. For sure, it's not a trivial thing to do, and much harder to do it well.

The biggest issue of my reading habit is that I always read word by word without paying too much attention to the *table of content*, *preface*, *index*, etc. It's like a task with a preset quantity target, and what I need to do is to reach that quantity, and automatically I gain the knowledge and the understanding. It's far from wrong. And that's why my understanding is still very shallow without a systematic knowledge graph even though the quantity is not small.

Another critical issue is that I don't like reading *difficult* books. *Adler* mentioned it's the *great* books that are beyond the readers that could help them the most, on not only the reading skills, but also the understanding of that subject. Favoring the easy books, I spent more time on fiction, and always shy away from hard ones, esp. some books that require heavy math or are mindboggling.

And I am obsessed with productivity, and also try to take in as much as possible. That's why recently I printed out a quote and stuck to the wall behind my computer, which says *Less is More*. That's exactly the same with the quantity versus the quality. And for most time we just chose the *quantity* side for its comparingly easiness.

By reflecting all my bad reading habits, and with the help of *Adler*'s *How to Read a book*, it's a good chance to give up some bad habits and pick up some good ones. Instead of reading more, I should try to read well by applying *Adler*'s Analytical Reading for each book that is *great* on a specific subject; With the *Inspectional Reading*, I could quickly build some basic understanding to the book in my hand, which could help create the big picture, and also answer some big questions like *what the book is about*, *how the author organizes the book's structure*, and even *whether I should analytically read this book*. And with the Syntopical Reading, I might even become an *expert* on a subject in a specific field. Therefore, *Adler* just gives his answers to my issues, and it could be a good chance to polish my reading skill now.

While does that mean we should not read fiction any longer?

*Adler* doesn't object to read fiction, and even if he does, I won't follow, since undoubtedly fiction including novels, sci-fi, poems, etc are an indispensable part of my life, which is unthinkable if there's none. But his one tip is very interesting, i.e *we should read the fiction as soon as possible, even one stop if possible*, which could allow us to completely immerse into the plots, and enjoy the *fantasy* the author creates. 

So I agree with this book a lot, and as a practical book as *Adler* points, *once you agree with a practical book, it's not finished yet after you complete the book, or think using your mind only, but you should act accordiingly.* 

Let's ACT then.
