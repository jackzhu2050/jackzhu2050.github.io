Teaching people how to work or how to read are some meta-questions we reflect a lot on our own, while also a lot of advices or researches have been made. Books with these advices are prone to scratching the surfaces only or taking a fit-all pattern(assume everything is a nail when you have a hammer).

*Deep Work* by *Cal Newport* is a very good one by counting those flaws. 

It covers both psychology and neuroscience which lays the foundation well, e.g our attention bandwidth, the willpower limit, etc. These researches justify our typical distractions encountering in our daily work, while it also gives us a solid theory to allow us to utilize our limited time and attention more wisely and efficiently. We might be overconfident when we're young and haven't experienced so much, while we grow old to respect more upon the nature, the mechanism, the physical laws, the mathematics formulas, etc. Admitting our weakness and the limit of our ability is a very important step to make a more practical and feasible plan. 

It also takes a long space to explain the idea of deep work. A Chinese proverb says *Opening any book is good*, and I think it's true for our ancestors due to the deficiency of books. Years ago when I was little I never refused any book I could grab, which just interested me all the time. And I could even spend hours reading the newspapers which were gluing on the walls in my remote village. While things changed so much in the last few decades, the deficiency never comes to information any longer, while it goes to our attention and time. Therefore, picking the right piece and utilizing time wisely become more important.

The good part of this book comes next, i.e how to apply the theory to practice. A lot of books often stop at the theory while the author seems to cherish their inks too much to write enough for how to apply, while the readers always expect with great passion. Counting the practical willpower limit(e.g 4 hours deep work at most per day), the author tells us how to adopt and utilize the deep work. We can get up early in the mornings to have 2 hours of deep work time to solve some difficult problems. We should be able to free up completely and don't worry about the emails, etc to prepare us well for the next day after ending a workday. We should be able to find some spare time in the evenings while our family falls asleep, esp. our kids. We should be able to take our time to ponder on something while walking, running, wandering, commuting, etc. This will give us a more balanced and effective day every day if we can stick to these rituals and then habits.

The author also takes himself as examples in the narratives of the book which is good and can pull the readers closer to the author and makes us feel it's not out of reach. 

There're something I cannot agree on for sure. As a professor the author tries to stay at some more quiet places for his deep work, while it would make it difficult for his students to reach him. He also mentioned how to evaluate a work's position in the shallow-deep span by how long a recent smart graduate needs to finish the same work. That might sounds reasonable and doable, while it doesn't count the importance and priority in the evaluation. A meeting might be shallow, but it might be very urgent and important to unblock others in the team, and in this case we cannot just delay or even ignore it by using this approach, and we'd better attend and finish it instead.

Another part I don't like this book is about its length. Similar to other business books, most of time it's not necessary to use such lengthy redundant paragraphs to state the same thing again and again while a brief phrase might satisfy.

Back to myself, which is the most important, *deep work*, or similar *Get Things Done*, or *10000 hours* are conveying the same idea, i.e at the information era with ubiquitous distractions around, being focus, getting deep, delivering quality work are the way to make a difference in either work life or family life, which always ends up being the similar routine: allocate time as long as possible without interfering and efficiently utilize the fragments of time while walking or commuting, and consolidate our learnings by teaching or writing(like this post).

It's always *easier said than done*. But stepping out of the comfort zone and starting with little and also recording the progress are always helpful to reach a better position for sure.
