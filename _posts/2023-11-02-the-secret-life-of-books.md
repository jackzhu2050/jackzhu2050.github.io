Books are so special an object that when we talk about reading we seem to not care so much about the object itself, but the content, the words, the emotion it emits. But surely books, in its physical form, are important and mean so much. 

Books can be viewed and checked and held even smelled. Once it is in your hand, it means not just some papers with weight, but an expectation, an exploration, and a possible change towards your mind. I guess that’s why we are so keen to ask celebrities to recommend books.

Books on a shelf, no matter how poor or mundane the shelf is, are there to show something about the owner. How the books are arranged, which are in the handy section, are they still new even without removing the plastic paper cover, or are they yellowish with some curled pages inside? They are the hints to tell you so much about the owner. Therefore, books are also so private, esp. when the books in a shelf in a person’s study.

Reading is not necessary to come with the material books, and any media seems to be fine, e.g what I’ve done for this book is via my ereader. I love how I could change the fonts, the type or the size, and I just put the reader on a plastic docker, and touch the screen to turn the page, which feels very different from reading via a physical book. I like leaving notes in the margins while reading, so I always have a ballpen around to scribble whatever in my mind at that moment. I enjoy the scribbled words in my books, and it gives an impression of effort and investment, and also some prints to stand the forgetfulness, at least those random words prove I’ve read this book even when I no longer remember anything.

I still think books are the best way to share knowledge, esp. in our current digital age. Was it because of our short attention span, or the overwhelming volume of the size or the heaviness and density of the knowledge within each page, which expels us from books? I don’t know. But one thing is clear that books, esp. good(e.g well-written with well-thought ideas) books, are the most efficient way to get into something new, or enjoy something amusing and inspiring. Twitter like short texts or Tik Tok like short videos are dominating what we consume each day, and seems it enforces our taste and ways of absorbing information. Now anything longer than 2 minutes seems too much and will be easily scrolled away. And reading books seems to be antique and obsolete. I wish this won’t become worse, esp. when some medias are still bolstering reading, e.g the NY Times, the Books Prize, and also books like this one.

Books about books are just like movies about movies, which are rare but convey the love and gratitude towards such an amazing object, and I genuinely hope they could stand the time and the radical societal change nowadays.
