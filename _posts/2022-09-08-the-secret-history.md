Accidentally I encountered this book *The Secret History* when I watched a
youtube video, and I gave it a try which is not a bad reading experience, and
actually the experience is pretty good and the story is riveting. 

It's more a story about meaning of life, which seems irrelevant when you are
poor and busy and struggling with your tough life. Richard is such a college
boy who is poor and doesn't have the luxury to think too much and practice some
dogmas about meaning of life. But he was pushed to such an adventure with a
series of unexpected events. 

Richard's family wasn't something he liked,
even worse he kinda hated it and that was why he dropped the major of med but
moved out of California and went to this East town to pursue the English
literature. Then, he met such a peculiar group of Greek learning people,
the teacher, the other 5 students in that small team. He was finally accepted
into such a cult-like group to study this archaic language and its great
literature. As a cult, it had its rituals, special ways of doing
things. Therefore, the four members(except Bunny and Richard) had a old ritual
to get rid of the flesh and the constraint of their bodies to reach a *state*
but it ended up with killing a peasant by accident, and even no one could
remember how it happened. Bunny was able to figure out what had happened, esp.
about the murder. Hence he exploited this secret by blackmailing Henry and
other members, e.g asking Henry to have the Rome trip, asking Francis to go to
the expensive restaurants, asking Camilla to icon his clothes, etc. And it
finally led to a state when no one could stand him any longer and decided to
kill him to avoid the leak of the secret.

Bunny was pushed off the cliff and dead. *I* was there watching the entire
murder, and *I* was part of it. After that watershed moment, seemed each
member had a very tough time to get out of it. One side of it was a bit of
regret about the murder when Bunny was everywhere, his belongings, his odor,
his accent, even his bullying. They might not look that bad or unbearable now
and some of his merits seemed to stand out prominently. The anxiety grew when
his body couldn't be found, and the big search, and the investigation from
local policemen and FBI, and the funeral. Getting drunk became very normal and
frequent for *me*, Francis, or Charles. *I* started to wonder about the
alternative life when nothing occurred, when *I* was as normal as others who
just attended the normal classes and enjoyed the normal parties. Nothing could
go back.

Henry become strange and the relationship between him and Camilla started to
become a problem. The twins were not *normal* and they lived together. Charles
couldn't bear the development of the relationship between Henry and his sister,
and started to drink too much. Such envy and peculiar love led to something
instable, and Camilla moved out of their rented house and lived in a hotel with
Henry, till one day Charles confronted Henry in the hotel, when Henry, Francis,
Camilla, *me* were all there. Charles, drunk, with a gun, tried to shoot and
kill Henry but ended up with *me* getting shot, and Henry's killing himself.
Henry explained to *me* that after that ritual and accident of killing, he
totally changed like a rebirth, and started to enjoy life and chase things he
wasn't able to before, like the plants, the Greek language, the love towards
Camilla.

It's a good story and shows an alternative journey of finding meaning of life,
which is too extravagant for the *normal* us. We're too busy and the life is
too overwhelming and pressured, and we are trapped within the narrow small
materialized world and try our best to meet our flesh needs, and who cares
the soul and the spirit? Is that important?

Surely like the layers of needs, we cannot dwell too much on the higher level
of needs when the lower ones cannot get satisfied. Even when we glimpse the sea
of soul sporadically, we will back off quickly with being overwhelmed by its broadness 
and depth. We cannot really get into that world, and that's fine. But how can
we have the vicarious excitement and pain of that world? That comes with the
books like this, and it serves that purpose fantastically.
