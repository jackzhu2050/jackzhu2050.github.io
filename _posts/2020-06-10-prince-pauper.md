I don't enjoy reading *fairy-tales* that much for it mostly ends up with a bright but not practical ending. Being a bit cynical, it's difficult for me to buy that narration. This one is not an exception.

In China, there's a TV show depciting the similar plot, i.e exchanging a pair of kids between a poor and a rich family. Audience might be curious and get interested in such strangeness for both the kids, and deeply believe both won't endure long in the wild environment. It's new and a bit exciting for both, esp. for the rich kid, since he knows the term is always has and end and he will eventually get back to his *normal* rich life. But how about the poor kid? Will he become a bit uneasy after living a rich life even though that's short? Will he start to doubt and despise his parents and complain the poor life he is living by contributing the root to his parents' ineptitude? All -- the TV channel, the sponsors, the rich family -- win except the poor family, which is like making money by exploiting the poor.

It's exactly same here in *Mark Twain*'s great book. I don't buy it a bit and I believe the author doesn't expect me to believe it a bit. The points I love is that the pauper gradually forgot the prince, his family and his mother, and he even starts to despise his own blood. That's normal and real. I understand that it's so overwhelming and enticing to sit on the throne and bear the crown. Once you get used to the power, it'll become impossible to turn away voluntarily. Say so many so-called *heros* in history who had exerted all their best to pursue the power with killing and cheating. As normal people, we show our approval by calling them *heros* even with their hands full of blood.

The pauper's final return to his family and giving up the crown is far beyond my expectation, while it becomes reasonable when we know it's a fairy-tale. We expect the good get rewarded and the bad get punished. We're thrilled to see either one gets their deserved reward or punishment, even when it's very bloody treating a person. We expect everyone could learn from the experience they'd undergone and become better, and keep on being good, which could only take place in fairy-tales for sure. In reality, we forget so quickly and become what we were used to be, and the world is continuing without a noticeable change.

Reading the book itself is not that much fun since I could guess the plot easily. But since it's the ancestors of so many later books or shows, it is still worth reading, while for me, I prefer his other two books about two naughty boys [Tom Sawyer](2020-04-22-tom-sawyer.md) and [Huckfinn](2020-05-01-huck-finn.md).
