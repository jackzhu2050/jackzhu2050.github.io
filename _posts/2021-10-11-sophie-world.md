Years ago, when I was in high school, my Chinese teacher was reading a book while she was staying with us in the after-class classes(we used to write homework at these classes). That was a big book with many pages, and I was wondering what might be this book about, since I could see her smiling face now and then. And I mustered up the courage to ask her what the book was, she smiled to me and told me the beautiful name.

So I've known it for a long time, but I have nevered read it until several days ago. I purchased the English translated version and gave it a read.

I knew it was about philosophy, but I didn't know the mystery and the suspense, or even the science fiction elements, which makes it even more interesting. Being led by *Sophie*'s adventure in the history of philosophy, we could encounter and interact with a lot of famous and wise guys, like Socrates, Plato, Kant, Freud and Sartre. Walking through the different forests about life, meaning, nature, existence, the paths are many and different, and they direct to different ways ahead. As an individual, we might not be able to figure out which way is the real one, or the absolute truth, but at least it serves us well with different ideas and provkes us to think hard and deeply. We might not follow a specific way but we could be greatly inspired by understanding what might be true underneath their theories.

And then *Sophie* just found out that she was only a character in the book which written by the major to his same-age daughter as a birthday gift. At that second, she might get very confused and couldn't understand what it might imply. But something really significant occurred, at least she knew that she was not free. Maybe we are more like the major's daughter, and we are lucky with flesh and blood, so we could perceive the world in a more concrete and direct manner. But are we free? do we have free will? If we are not so confident about the answer, we might more or less be similar to *Sophie*, who is only a puppet and whose life is out of their control. Even when *Sophie* realized she was not free, she and her teacher didn't give up and became discouraged, but they tried to fight for their lives instead, to grasp the very trivil chance to win an escape. And it ended up being able to live in an invisible world who could observe and even intervene the *real* world.

So which type of philosophy do I believe? I might say the latter philosophers or the contemporary ones who lived close to us in time are weighed more in my balance, since typically they could synthesize the ideas in the past and could make a more practicial or something we could relate to more. So I don't think everything is material or objective, and we are not just a sophisticated machine. We have our soul and we have our emotion, and we could perceive and reason. Feeling and thinking are important, just like *The unexamined life is not worth living* or *I think, therefore I am*. We might be not out of the law of nature, but we could pursue our happiness, and achieve something *Higher* by sensing, thinking and reasoning.

So this book is really a good which reminds me another book I picked up days ago, i.e *The story of Philosophy*. I know that book is also famous for its easy reading, but it falls short comparing to *Sophie*. Maybe I should pick it up again with some good foundation by *Sophie*'s teaching.
