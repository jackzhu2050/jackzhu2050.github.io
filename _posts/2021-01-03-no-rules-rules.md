I love *running* or *jogging* very much. It might be on the sidewalk, with cars and buses come and go; It might be in the school's playground, with a lot of young faces; It might be along the school roads, under the lamps, with shadow's alternating between being short and being long. I love jogging on the playground the best, where you could jog slowly or walk by staring your cellphone, or just talk with your friends with a low voice. 

While I am jogging, *Airpod* is always there with playing some sounds, and sometimes I enjoy listening to the podcast which has been stacked with hundreds of unplayed episodes; and sometimes, I prefer listening to an audio book. So it might be very possible that you could identify a guy who is running with a smile on his face, or sometimes you could even hear a laugh.

It doesn't mean everything I listen to is joyful, but mostly they are, even when there's no humor at all but some wisdom or wit by the speaker. The track on the playground seems not that infinite any longer, and each round is not that struggling, since someone is whispering to my ears constantly and intimately.

*No Rules Rules* is absolutely not something evocative regarding emotions. It's a mere business book to tell you how to better manage an organization, though there're some anecdotes and stories here and there, which could free you from dullness for a while. Business books are not for entertainment as everyone knows, while it must be helpful based on the truth and the learned experience from failures. But you should never push it too hard or generalize it too much to make it a universal formula which could be applied anywhere, and this is a very common flaw for a lot of *good* business books(not to mention the *bad* ones).

In the book *Reed* makes a bunch of bold claims which sound impractical at first glance, e.g the pursuit of talent density, the lift of vacation and expense policy, the requirement of candor, the top pay, etc. Not every item is new here, or even no one is new, but when applying them to a *Netflix* like company is totally different comparing to a hypothesis in a paper.

About *talent density*, no one objects to have a high density for sure, while the cost is huge in practice. In programming, we all know the *10x developers* and its implication, i.e we want to have the *10x developers*. But how about the cost? and what if he is *3x* or *1.5x*? Even though he might be a *10x developer* regarding his ability and skill set, whether he could apply it *10x* in a daily manner is still a question. But I think everyone agrees a *better than average or adequate* employee is always a good investment.

Taking days off is good which serves as an opportunity for employees to take a break and refresh themselves. But nowadays with the fast-paced progress of technology and being divulged with overwhelming news and information every second, we always have *important* things to do(check the backlog in your agile tool). Even when we're taking a vacation, we have to be online in case. But is that really *important*? in most cases, the answer is negative. But the fear of falling back grips us tightly and the vacation has been delayed, shortened or even canceled. We felt exhausted and fatigued. Lifting the vacation policy, or just following the official vacation policy is always a good thing. 

However, lifting the expense policy is a little different. Typically, expense control is always the tightest part of a company. It makes sense to have a tight outflow control while an inflow as broad as possible, as a financial advisor gives as the rule of thumb for a family. *Netflix*'s *act in Netflix's best interest* seems like a bold but actually a very wise policy. It doesn't mean *Netflix* allows every employee to spend as much as he wants, but actually as reasonable as possible but also enjoys the benefits of the low friction of the traditional approval process, at least there's the audit process as the final resolve.

The top pay for its talents is also very alluring. The approach of *Netflix* is to give you some percentage higher than your market value. The tricky part is how to determine your *market value* objectively, or it ends up to being which source we should trust when there's a discrepancy. Talking about your compensation is always tricky and even intimidating and you expose yourself to a possibly-being-fired situation which everyone is trying to avoid. But for some time, we always feel we are under-paid and we want to be fairly treated. That negotiation comes. The better way might be actively offered by the employer, while that is very rare. And you knock the door of your boss with so much frustration and intimidation.

Being candid should always come after learning in advance. We don't expect blunt advice without knowing anything but from his gut. Being candid is not always a good idea, esp. in some cultures, as the author puts in the *going global* chapter. But in general, it is when it's done properly, which means you should gather enough information and learn the details and even interview some related individuals before giving your advice, esp. the negative ones. For a rational individual, we know we're not perfect(and no one is perfect), and we are open to developmental advice to allow us to grow and adapt over the course; while we also are emotional and sensitive, we appreciate a better and more elegant way to deliver it, which makes the candid advice-giving becomes an art which is very difficult to manage.

How about the *keeper test*? That might sounds uncomfortable for a lot of people. When we give the 360 assessment to our peers, are we completely objective? when we ask ourselves whether we should *keep him*, where does the strong feeling of *yes* or *no* come from? Is that answer objective, or it's just a vague impression from some trivial things while interacting with him where you inadvertently ignored some other very important things either positive or negative? Thus, for me, the *keeper test* seems to be a bit of arbitrary and blunt, which might or might not reflect the employee's actual contribution.

After finishing listening to the book, I have to say it's not a bad book, but it's not a practical book either, or at least not universally practical. The *dots* the author wants to connect are good, but they have to be applied with some strong prerequisites, which is *you must have the best employees which are nearly close to ideal*. Such ideal employees could *act in the company's interest*, could *assess without any self-interest or bias involved*, could *objectively give the accurate market value of themselves*, could *take enough vacation but not exploit the policy*, could *deliver their candid advice for others objectively and accept others' candid advice eagerly and adapt accordingly*, could *do the keeper test regularly to others and to themselves and are ready to leave if they no longer meet the requirement*, etc. *IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE*. And that's why the vacation and expense policy is still the mainstream, and negotiating the pay raise is always a pain. Or it must be some company like *Netflix* whose bank has piles and piles of money, but once its user growth reaches to the ceiling and growth is staggering, what might be happen? that's something we can expect from the next book from *Reed* in some years.
