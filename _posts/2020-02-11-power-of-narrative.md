I am a huge fan of [Econ Talk](https://www.econtalk.org/) and a [very recent
episode](https://www.econtalk.org/robert-shiller-on-narrative-economics/) with the guest of *Robert Shiller* haunts in my mind for a long time.

*Robert Shiller* is surely a great economist and also a Nobel Prize winner as we all know. And we might think he would favor formal rigid theory over informal sayings, which is not fully correct if you've listened to this podcast.

I am thinking about the role of narratives in a broader view. It does play a very important role in economics, e.g the famous invisible hands by Adam Smith, the prisoner's dilemma about the information cost, etc.

We tend to love reading stories more since we were a very little kid. We still remember the stories being told by our parents, even though the persons behind those stories might not be accurately depicted. We remembered those persons and their stories and then we create a more general and less accurate image of the person or the thing. It will be enough for most of the time, and it also lays a good foundation for our future digging if needed.

In Computer Science, there're so many great narratives. We say *Don't reinvent wheels* to avoid a repeat. We say *premature optimization is the root of all evils* to focus the goal more in the early phase. We say *Don't call us, we'll call you* (the Hollywood principle) to reduce the coupling, etc.

And this morning I just read another good piece of analogy about programming.

> we have two sandwiches ABC and PBQ, and we write B(meat) as a subroutine, and we can replace it to something else easily(with the same interfaces, e.g vegetables). The subroutine is an awesome concept in programming. Putting it further, we might want to replace AC and PQ later, e.g instead of bread, we want to use pancakes. Here we can think of context.

An excerpt from *the Fluent Python*.

The subroutes are so important and are the basic elements of building any programs. While context might be new, and it's great in Python if you use it correctly. (Think of *with* statement)

Narratives are important as a way to spread general information in an informal and loose manner. While it's so important, once you think of it, which normally has a very short line and easy to be remembered, you will think of a bunch of other important things around. 

That is the real power of narrative.
