*Lawrence* might not be so acknowledged by some critics but his readers are filled with respect, resonance, and gratitude for his being able to express something deep inside. After reading his [Chatterley's lover](2020-05-07-chatterley-lover.md), *Sons and lovers* another masterpiece just came across to my mind and days of reading time.

It's more than common that fathers are conservative while mothers are easy-going, which normally makes kids be closer to their mom esp. sons. 

For sons, mothers are the first woman they encounter during their life, and also the most crucial lifetime. They show different sex with a different body curve, ways of doing things, or even the sound of talking. They tend you carefully, cuddle you closely, wash you gently. And they might be the woman you stay with for the longest time of your life. And it becomes easy and natural that there's a kind of love kindling between sons and moms. 

For moms, I can only guess. No one is completely satisfied with their husband for sure, like the husbands with their wives. They hold their feelings and some kind of dissatisfaction and disappointment grow day after day against their husband. Until another man turns up in their life. They pay their close attention to them to raise them, to teach them, to experiment over them, which sons they raised will grow to a person that they could identify with, love with, be satisfied with.

Therefore, the bond between them just grows like wild grass, unstoppably and unceasingly. Until one day, the baby turns to a boy, and turns to a teenager and then a man, he is old enough to try something new, esp. the love, the desire, that he could not acquire from his mother. They become a bit distant and gradually share less time together. One becomes more lusty, while another becomes more frail and less attractive. What he feels is no longer a deep love, but misery by knowing the aging of his lovely mom, which is so difficult to stand with. Another female is there, not far, glowing with charm, smelling like a flower, full of ripeness of sex. An invisible force is pulling you away from that weakening lover, while you indulge yourself in the new lover with freshness and satisfaction.

And one day, sons become older and stronger, while moms become more frail and cannot walk for long. Also moms become more like kids who are easy to be irritated while they keep their emotion and suffering inwards since they know their lovers are gone and will never come back. They amble down the familiar roads lonely, and pick up the old memories that they share. And they are gone one day that sons will never be able to see their young and beautiful, old and ashen faces that are never alien to them.

It's like a doomed tragedy with a determined heartbroken ending, which everyone involved is destined to undergo the pain. The mom, the son, the lovers, without exception.

Another interesting part of this novel is about the two lovers Paul interacts with. One is deep, and full of passion with a great understanding of you, while with a tight grip of every part of you. Another is shallow, and cannot reach the point of understanding like a soulmate. Whoever you will choose to live the life with? The dilemma is so common which is still bewildering a lot of young lovers. You might also end up with a similar plot of jumping from one to another without settling.

The book might be old, while the love and the ways we face them is still relevant, and still intrigues me a lot.
