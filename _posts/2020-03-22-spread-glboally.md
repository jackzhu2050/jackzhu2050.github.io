The number of death in Italy has exceeded China, which really shocked me, since we all know China has such a huge population. And then the number of positive in New York has passed 10,000 in a very short time. Also news about Switzerland, France, etc all goes beyond our expectation.

Hours ago, when I got downstairs with my wife and played a bit badminton, then we went to buy a takeaway from a restaurant nearby. I told my wife that it's almost been 2 months since last time I came down and took something from the restaurant. A street bridge is almost there which connects our neighborhood and the university. People wearing masks are wandering here and there. People lining up wait to enter the supermarket after checking their temperature. Women are practicing some dances as normal by following some catchy songs.

Seems everything is back to normal here, while the virus is spreading in other countries.

Talking with my wife along the way home, I told him months ago when we locked down the cities to battle against the virus, I listened to some podcasts about the report to such lockdowns which are normally negative esp. about violation of people's rights. Now many cities and countries are following the same strategies. My wife sarcastically told me that "moons abroad is more round than ours". I became sildent and a bit embarrassed. 

I still believe every country should allow people to speak out and should be confident enough to do that. And finally we are closer to the truth even when there're different sayings. Providing more information and being able to acknowlege the fault they have made are also very important. Everyone knows that everyone does fault, so does a country.

But I also think again about my stance. In such special circumstance, I appreciate such tough approach to contain the virus even with a lack of appropriate procedure to some degree. If lockdown of a city could stop the spreading of the virus, we surely should do it. Only when we contain the virus, the economy could get back to normal, and the industries that have been damaged could recover, and also the people who have been laid off could get another job. Otherwise who can risk their lives to travel around, live in a hotel, have dinners with friends in restaurants?

I initially thought the epidemic might only spread within China, while it turns out to be naive. With this, I hope every country could react properly, or even by following China's strategy, at least that proves to be effective. As some officials in the US said: virus doesn't know whether you're a Republic or a Democratic. And *virus doesn't know whether you're in a communism country or a capitalism country*. Let's defeat the virus by following the effective approach at first.

2020 as the 1st year of a new decade, is so weird so far. If a black swan's turnning up is rare, now is a bunch of black swans that are quacking around. Tommorrow is surely a new day, and the sun will turn up for sure, but we might not know whether we're harrowed by something, or whether we are able to enjoy an extravagence of reading a book in the afternoon.

*Life is vulnerable.* My wife sighed while playing badminton with me.
*This will be a memory.* I tried to cheer her up.
