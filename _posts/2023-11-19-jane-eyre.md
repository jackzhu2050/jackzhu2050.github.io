I still remember the time when I read *Jane Eyre* for the first time. It was more than
20 years ago when I was in the high school. As a poor student, I didn't have spare money
to buy books as I wanted, and I had to save from my already very tight budget each week
to buy this book. To make the best use of the money, I bought the thickest book on the ground
where the bookseller was selling his pirate books. That was with the name "Four famous
classics in the world" and **Jane Eyre** was of course one of them.

With the precious book in hands, I scanned the book leaves which was so thin each page which
made me even happier, because it meant it had more content. The font size was small, and I was 
immediately immersed in, forgetting where I was and what time it was.

I still remember one of my essays was read in public by my literature teacher, where I mentioned
**Jane Eyre** and mentioned I loved it very much. Maybe that was not the truth, maybe it was just
because that might be the only one famous book I had read at that period. But I was thrilled with
a composed face pretending I didn't care that much. That was a wonderful time for me.

Over two decades later, I picked the book again ,and this time it's an English version, which looks
even thicker than the one in my memory. Maybe it was the better paper, maybe it was our shortened 
attention span after so long time. Oh, such a wonderful reading time. I didn't remember the humorous
conversations but this time they made me laugh a lot, and I really appreciated how the great author
put the words that fabulous way.

People say it's a precursory book about feminism. **Bronte** might not have the obvious intention, but
surely **Jane** was a very strong and independent woman that she made the decisions by her own on the most
important occasions in her life.

The first time of such decision-making moment was when she was abused again by her cousin and was locked
in that stifling cage for days, and she made her first important decision, that she would leave the house and 
go to the school, any school, even any place, but not here. She met her first lovely friend **Helen** there, who
was like a mentor and helpful friend to help her walk through the bitter and dark days. Surely there was that
beautiful teacher who pursued the truth over some authority and power. She cleaned **Jane**'s name after being
claimed as a liar.

The 2nd time was when **Jane** and **Mr Rochester** had the wedding and the wedding was interrupted with 
**Mr. Rochester**'s marriage status. **Jane** made the decision to leave instead of being the mistress. She had
some misery life in finding shelters and food, but she was lucky to be saved by her cousin(they didn't know
at that moment). And she met the family who later turned out being his closest relations. And she shared her
property to them equally, and freed her two sisters from the similar life as hers. She didn't submit to the 
holy mission from her cousin, who wanted to marry her and went to India together to serve the God, which for sure
had no love, but duty and mission. She refused.

The 3rd time was when **Jane** returned to look for **Mr. Rochester** and found the blind and crippled **Mr. Rochester**
her love. And she didn't hesitate and made her decision to take care of him, not because of sympathy, but for
the deep love towards that man. They got married and lived a happy life and finally **Mr. Rochester** recovered
one eye and could see things.

And there are some other very nice narratives within the pages, and as a reader, I couldn't help laughing or smiling
during the reading time, and really enjoyed the time. **Jane Eyre** is not just one book, and its plot reminds other
books that I've read which obviously stole some ideas. Yes, **Jane Eyre** deservers the name of "Four famous classics
in the world", and it would be still relevant in future.
