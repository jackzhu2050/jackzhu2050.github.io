I am reading a very interesting book *The Man who solved the Market* by a WSJ journalist. You can expect a lot of juicy stories in this book, and it will never fail you. Jim Simons's story itself is stunning for he made great achievements in his life for not once but 4 times, while we ordinary people are never close to any of them. Other mathematicians' stories are also very attention-grabbing like fantasies. A lot of people holding a PhD in math or physics (even won some prestigious medals) are often assumed as poor or at least are irrelevant with a decent fortune. Those guys in the book are quite opposite, which they applied what they'd learned to the trade and made a good fortune.

Today I read to know they built a model not expecting to always output a perfectly accurate trade decision, while expecting to give a 51 over 100 accuracy. This reminds me what I did 2 years ago when we tried to build a high-frequency model to trade in cryptocurrency market. At that time I doubted about its feasibleness so much that I even gave a counterargument using a perpetual motion machine as the metaphor. And naively arguing that if it is something feasible, others should have already built it, and once you deploy it in real markets, others won't participate in the market at all since they'll always lose money without using such model.

My nearsighted understanding was due to my lack of knowledge and didn't have a very good understanding about probability. Certainty in trade doesn't exist at all otherwise people will exploit quickly. Imagine the effective market hypothesis here. But the story in this book shed some light over my understanding. Under uncertainty and overflow of information, it's possible to achieve a higher than 50% success in trade for either high or low frequency in a long period, i.e law of large numbers.

I also invest in the stock market, and I am kind of overconfident about my running the strategy, esp. it's hard to sell a stock when it rises a lot.(a guy in the book had the same issue. üê±) With reading these books, the confidence will subdue with several hands of money losing for sure. That might be the way to pay the tuition. Even though we all agree we can never beat the market, and the institution, and our money will be reaped finally, I still believe there is the opportunity somewhere to be identified and exploited to earn a decent fortune like Jim Simons. I know Jim Simons is greatly talented and he reached where he is now through a lot of failures and losing money. But at least it proves that's possible. 

That's why [Xuyou made such a career shift recently](https://blog.youxu.info/2020/02/04/my-leaps-strategy/). He is a smart guy with no doubt and I hope he can be successful esp. because the computation power is much cheaper and AI is around and mature today.
