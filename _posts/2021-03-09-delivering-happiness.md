Encountering with *Tony Hsieh* was all an accident, and it also looks very tragic, when I accidentally browse through the *Hacker News* to learn the news of his death. It's not unusual to see a person on the hot list, esp. when someone just passed away, but when I read a bit the comments, I was completely moved by the detailed stories that had happened in past years.

*Zappos* is less known in China and it's a pity that I couldn't perceive how a good customer service feels like. It might be like *Haidilao* in China to exceed your expectation, while in different fields. More e-commerical companies are pursing to reach most if not all people with cheap but low-quality products. Sometimes I am stunned by how bad the products look like, which I mean the emerging grocery e-commerce recently in China. Maybe *Pinduoduo* changed or corrected the perception of customers, which might be not an upgrade of consumption, but a downgrade in some way.

Back to this book, I really enjoyed reading it. When *Tony* was little, how he tried to make money and how he managed to skip the musical instrument practice are all very fasinating and inspiring. I told my wife after reading these stories, "a person's future can be figured out by observing his behaviors when he is little". This is actaully a Chinese proverb. What I want to say is that for a young kid, it might be better to explore different things even some wild things. As a parent, we might not want to discourage them if they explore around instead doing homework or playing piano.

*Tony* graduated from *Harvard* and went to *Oracle*, and quitted to start the *LinkExchange*. The course was also bumpy and sometimes it was close to collapse. It inspired me a lot since *Tony* didn't stick to what he learned in the college, but explored different things based on the opportunity and resource. Normally we, after taking years of education in a domain, are eager to explore the opportunities that are close to our majors instead of in a broader view.

After selling the company to *Microsoft*, *Tony* started the venture fund to invest in some early phase companies, and *Zappos* is among them. Reading the history of *Zappos* is very interesting. The crises turned up one by one in the early years, esp. when the cash was almost burning over. *Tony* sold his apartment to extend the cash line and finally got the credit line from *Well Fargo*. The change of *Sequoia* about investing in *Zappos* is also fascinating. *Sequoia* seems to hold very steady rules about investing even when it's possible to miss a chance. I guess that's why it's the greatest venture capital. Another haunting question is about *Zappos*'s founder and CEO *Nick*, why he is so low-profile and left *Zappos* in 2006? The reason underneath is not stated in *Tony*'s book, but it was mentioned in an interview with *Nick*, which mentioned he left because he loved start-ups while *Zappos* had become a big company then.

In the end of the book, *Tony* talked about the culture and core values, which might be the most important and inspiring parts if you're an enterpreneur. While I enjoyed the final part, i.e *Tony*'s understanding about *happiness*. The points are not new but it can echo to my inner voice very well. The *why* question is always difficult to explore or even it's dangerous to explore? Because in the deep level, you will doubt your status quo and routine, or even what you're working and its meaning. *Higher purpose* is great or even *passion* is awesome, since we could immerse ourselves without even noticing the time, the surroundings, or ourselves. That is a very cool state. While most of us are trapped in the instant *pleasure*, since they're easier to pursue and could easily obtain, but it doesn't last long. Can we purse the higher level of happiness, e.g *passion* or *higher purpose*? It's not that easy, but needs a lot of focus and deep work to achieve.

It's sad to know *Tony* is dead, esp. after finishing the book. He is a candid and inspirational individual, and he practised and pursued his own happiness and also tried to deliver happiness to others. If he were still here, he would be able to deliver more. *RIP*.
