For business, what struck me most in recent years is not from Apple's 1 trillion market cap, or Google's breakthrough in AI via Deepmind's AlphaGo, or Tiktok's great success around the world, but it's Microsoft's way of changing, or in *Satya*'s own phrase, i.e *Refresh*. As a software engineer, or coder, Microsoft is the first company I encountered in my study life, even at that time, I think computers are same as Windows, and working in a computer is same as using Office. And then the VC, SQL Server, .net, etc, they all played a role in my later study and career life, which often left a more negative impression, esp. after switching to Linux and Mac years later, with the comparison in mind.

In my mind a perception towards Microsoft grows and ends up being like an incumbent who just wields his sword against his customers for money without providing very helpful tools, and just exploits the position it has in the market, and the huge cost the customers have to afford if they choose to change. For professional computer workers, Microsoft's reputation gradually worsens over time, esp. with the advent of the mobile era.

Now Apple and Google have already dominated the market of the mobile operating system, and Microsoft has been left far behind. And seems its reaction is very slow even when it has great knowledge and experience of building the operating system in the first place. Then Windows Phone fails, the acquisition of Nokia seems to be a failure, and they don't catch up the mobile train at all. At this point, I was wondering Microsoft might be another Nokia and could die very soon, while *Satya* just proved me wrong within several years.

Microsoft starts to embrace the technical community, i.e the developers, by providing an engineer-friendly system. And its VS Code is also very awesome, not just in Windows but in every mainstream operating system. In fact, I am writing this blog post using VS Code with my Macbook. The Azure becomes a very important player in the cloud service battlefield. And the Team software becomes very good to use and part of the Office suite. The acquisition of Github also proves their new attitude towards the developers and their community.

Microsoft just *refreshes* itself, and my perception refreshes too. Microsoft is very different now comparing to the company years ago. Its market cap also exceeded 1T very soon after Apple, which reminds me a story that Bill Gates sold his shares of Microsoft which would worth a lot more if he keeps them. But who can predict the future even like Bill Gates who knows the ins and outs of the company better than anyone else?

*Satya*'s *Refresh* book is good by introducing what he's done after becoming the 3rd CEO of Microsoft, which is good and inspiring and of course very tough if you can imagine the incumbent's strength against the change -- when a change is about to happen, the great risk of failure and uncertainty. Looking back today, we might say it's really great to make such a big change in such a huge company and the change proves to be a success. But we cannot ignore the failures over the course. Nokia acquisition, mobile operating system, Skype, etc.

Besides his change to Microsoft, his insights about some big questions are also very inspiring. The 3 forces for the future, i.e mixed reality, AI, quantum computing, are huge for sure, but till today, they're still not in the horizon as a mass market product. The role and responsibility of a big company like Microsoft, the leadership of a CEO in such companies, the collaboration among leaders, policymakers, politicians, how to balance the efficiency and equality, how to protect the privacy from legal and illegal accessing, etc are all becoming very important questions to answer, and *Satya* wrote his answers.

Globalization becomes less popular in recent years, even in countries like the US and some European nations. It's not hard to understand the plummeted share of the pie with globalization in developed countries in recent decades which leads the people in the country to be against it. But the trend might be not easy to revert, esp. when the 3 forces become more tangible around us, and human labor becomes less involved, we might expect more cooperation among the countries to make the pie bigger. And Microsoft and other companies would play a more important rule.
