I really appreciate the progress in open courses, which opens the doors to everyone around the world to top tier education. You can gain access to a lot of resources in Coursera or edX, while someone might argue the companies' for-profit might compromise the effectiveness of the courses from the great prestigious schools. And also the quality varies too much which also introduces a great barrier to students. For me, I don't like free stuff which almost equals low quality or more costly in the long run. For overwhelming classes, I barely agree that's even a problem. Too many choices are always better than insufficient choices, and great ones will stand out for sure.

Undoubtedly the teachers have different styles and commit differently in their courses. And even the technical quality varies significantly, like video/audio quality, angles of the video, interactions with live class, etc. These technical questions will surely degrade the courses and we cannot expect too considerable changes in the coming years.

The MOOC in China is prospering in recent years too. The collaboration between the schools and netease(a famous Chinese internet company) makes the content much easier to access. The content is more diverse now, covering a great many topics that you can imagine. The teachers from those famous universities mostly hold a very solid background, and most of them studied abroad which surely will widen their view and also benefit the students.

This is one side of the image as the knowledge economics is emerging. Digestion of books, short quick superficial courses, exploiting anxiety of knowledge deficiency, etc is another side. They push hard of their courses and will leave the intangible progress to yourself whether the progress is there or not. They employ some traditional sales tactics to have dealers in different cities to attract more users by giving a very generous commission. The quality and the promised gain are farfetched. Someone calls this as IQ tax with some truth inside. I am not that extreme and believe there're great courses but their profit-pursuing and providing good education might not align that much.

Seems there's another path here, and that's *Master Class*. Professionals provide professional courses with more easy-to-digest format(~10 mins per segment) and high quality of videos/audios(the recordings are much better). After being recommended, I immediately decided to take these classes. Great guys like Paul Krugman, Samuel Jackson, Martin Scorsese, Malcolm Gladwell etc are all there. I am grateful to this company to bring those great guys in different industries here and spend their time on such education things.

I might give a lengthy review after finishing some of the exciting *master class*es.
