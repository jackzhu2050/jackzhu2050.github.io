If you mention the name *the catcher in the rye* to a Chinese who knows a bit literature, they must know this one for sure, even though they might not know what the book is about. It applies to me too. I've known this book for so long, and I've read it before in Chinese translation, which only gave me an impression of youth fiction and nothing more. Maybe it was because of the translation to eliminate the humor the original text contains, maybe it was because I was too young to appreciate the book.

And then I read it again recently in its original English version. I have to say it is overwhelming and impressive greatly. The way the author put it, the words he used, the tone he set are all amazing. We have some Chinese writers who can be in the same group to move the story using the humorous and sarcastic way, however it might be not exactly equally good. The story is short in pages and timeline, and it seems to be like a random wander after he was kicked out by the school. And things took place one by one like a drama. It's like a drama since the author just put things all together into a very short time, one or two days, and put them over one person. That just makes the drama, and heavy with surprise. Hence the talk with his old teacher, the bar, the movies, the whore, the harassment, with his sister, etc, all occurred in such a dense way.

I enjoy the whole book very much, while my favorite part is his interaction with his sister. I've got a daughter, and I always feel grateful and happy by her wit and amusement when talking with her or looking at her. She can absolutely make the conversation fun and hilarious. And the good part is her love to you, even though everything is so depressing as the author put it. Her way to ask you to stay, to care for you, to really worry about your study and future are all killing you. Then she wanted to go west with you together with a serious face, and you were moved and you just dropped the idea.

So the book is not just humorous or sarcastic, but it's also filled of love and sweetness. It's genuine to convey the feelings of a teenager, and how depressing he is, and he is so lost with himself. Working in a ranch, or going west, is like a whim, while he is searching the meanings of life. And we all know it's not easy even when we look back. His dream of becoming *the catcher in the rye* is really nice. I mean that he enjoys talking with kids and protecting them is really good, esp. for a teenager that just gets close to the boundary of the adult life, which is boring, complex, or even dangerous. He is scared for such changing, and he is deeply worried, as we all did.
