This play I've been heard for so long, and I always wonder what the story might be like that is able to make it so famous and impactful. Then I bought the book, read it and was completely moved by it. This is such a great experience that I cannot imagine what else could bring to me with a comparable level.

*Arthur Miller* is such an awesome playwright, who could put so much information, life, conflict, suspense, cruelty, love, and more in such a small book. The length is thin, while the feeling is thick and heavy. It could easily get identified with me and my life.

The *Salesman* is very ordinary like every ordinary man around us. We spend a lot of money to buy a house with a very high mortgage which is like a mountain over our shoulder with decades not years. It's with you for your nearly entire life and reminds you every month about a person who will knock your door and ask you a pile of money. Looking ahead, it's limitless, and the end is far far away which seems unreachable. We live our life very carefully, and work very hard to be able to pay the mortgage to expect the final ownership of that small apartment, needless to say the 70 years and no one knows what will happen after that.

We cannot breathe freely since we need the job we currently have. We cannot stand straightly since we might offense someone who might affect us one way or another. Some big mouths promised something important to you and he forgot that completely when you try to raise it up again years later, and you really need that help. We failed our family, and we failed ourselves.

It might be like the last straw or consolation to have a *good* kid around with so much love and time that have been committed to. They become tall and grow old, but they can never reach our expectancy as a parent for a kid. We are always so stringent and greedy to them. It is doomed to failure from the first moment for them to be our kids. And with such big pressure for so many years, how they might turn to be? How they might grow the feeling with us? It always falls short.

Walk with her, hold her hands, watch her climbing the monkey bar, see her falling down, feel the pain when treating her injury. Day after day, she becomes part of you, not just daughter. You can open eyes wide to feel the pain while the doctor is stitching her wounds with very sharp needle, without a wink, but we are so terrified with needles for our whole life. She summons her courage, holds your hands with a tight grip, murmurs to herself, "it's just one second". At that moment, as a parent, you feel the strength of this little body, and you feel the pains so real, and you're nearly out of breath when the needle starts to dance in the doctor's hand.

What might turn out to be years later when she grows old? I don't know, and I don't really care. The time, love, things that we share, do, enjoy together really matter. Even when the things end up beyond our wildest imagination, the time with her still holds itself so strong, and so tall.

At last, the *salesman* made his decision, and made that move. We might say he is fake, and ignorant, and unaware, while I must say such blindness is not uncommon. With the days we undergo, and the work we do each day, we grow blind or blindly optimistic as part of the requirement of the career, also as part of our pursuit of meaning of our life. We are not able to, or we are scared of unveiling that drape of truth,  and we cannot bear the truth from others either. 

With our entire life, we expect a successful child, and we believe in our job, but in the salesman's funeral, no one comes, and no one pays respect. Laying in the fresh coffin, will he be rueful with deep sorrow? Will he start to think about the truth of life?

And we finally say farewell.
