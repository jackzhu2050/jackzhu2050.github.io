Life is never equal among people, and at the starting point of our being given birth, we fell into a group
which would significantly affect us and the road ahead. It not only means the material stuff like food, drink,
clothes, housing which money could buy, but also means the spiritual stuff like what you could enjoy and appreciate,
your taste, your demeanor. *Aristocracy is not nurtured but more a natural thing.* It sounds very sad for people
like us, but what we could do to alter the destined road?

Knowing the beauty of the surrounding, or even trying to enjoy them which is not supposed to be *your thing*, could
invoke a very different impression to people above you in rank. Like Leonard walked a whole night and climbed the mountains,
it definitely surprised Helen and Meg. The two ladies started to think him as a member of their group, at least in
spiritual area. They gave advice to him which caused him to be removed from his job. And it seemed to strengthen their
relationship with the new element of guilt and sympathy. At the end, Helen made a further step and eventually they had an 
evening together, which finally caused Leonard's death.

Leonard didn't want to settle down or did what the society expected you and your class to do, but he tried to climb the ladder
to enter a higher class. He failed and was crushed into pieces.

Meg seemed to be more rational and knew the line between different social classes and she stuck to that. On one side she shew her
empathy to Leonard for his reading books and walking at nights, and on another side, she agreed to Henry about the business
principles which were more cold and indifferent. She were able to do whatever she wanted since she was rich and in a higher class, hence
she didn't succumb too much, like she jumped out of the car, just like *Lady Bird*.

Helen is more emotional and passionate comparing to her sister. Her love with Paul was the prologue of the whole story, which made
the subsequent stories possible, e.g the relationship between Meg and Mrs. Wilcox, and the love between Meg and Mr. Wilcox. Her
impulse to have one night with Leonard would finally took his life, while she might not be that sorry. Like her sister, she could do
whatever she wanted. But it didn't apply to Leonard-like men. He had to ask mercy around for money, for rent, or food. He might be able
to refuse the money from Helen to save his dignity, but the self-doubt and the cost of keeping his dignity were torturing him greatly.
He died without knowing his son and Helen didn't tell him.

Mrs. Wilcox loomed in the whole book even though she died very early. She seemed to know everything, even the things that were about to unfold.
*Howards End* was in her will to give to Meg, which became true at the end, even though in a different and unexpected way. The relationship
between her and Meg seemed to be fine, which seemed to be out of material world, but more a spiritual world. And they had the privilege to 
enjoy that.

The book with yellow pages is beside myself on the table, and I love the touch of it. The book is not an easy reading, and it pushes you
to think about the life and the possible meaning.
