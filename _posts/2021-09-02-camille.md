I cannot remember whether I've read the book *Camille* or not, and I guess I must have but must be in a very early age and a Chinese translation. This time I read it in English version, though still a translation version, it really moved me greatly.

It is a novel so it must be fictional, even though the author claims in the book that it's a true story. But I do believe it existed and it took place. It's like a dream that hangs somewhere very clearly, and we all know we cannot go, but we also know it's something noble, something really beautiful, and something worthy persuing. I guess that's why we could be greatly moved and love this novel so much, which just shows a dream of everyone comes true.

It's a dream since for an ordinary person, it's beyond our reach. It doesn't mean we cannot do if we really try our best, but it means we give the idea up after contemplating it for a while and balancing the cost and benefit, just like a rational man. We're not mad, and we are reasonable, and we are cowards. In our real life, we might have the chance to enounter a person that attracts us a lot, and we enjoy talking with him or her, and we seem to be able to talk more freely and unreservedly for once in our entire life. But once we want to start a further step by showing some passion or feeling towards him or her, we are so scared and we cannot move our leg at all. Finally we give the whole idea up, and just keep a loose relationship with regrets and self-disdain. We grow old quickly.

*Marguerite* is surely a *noble* lady, and her becoming a martyr seems to be a tragedy. But what caused all this? *Armand*'s father did play an important role in the process, esp. when he met *Marguerite* face to face and persuaded her to leave his son by analyzing the reality and the possible effect to his daughter who was about to get married. *Armand* himself did also play a role. Did he have any doubt about the reason when *Marguerite* had such a big change over his father's visit? Even though he read her letter and felt extremely disappointed, he might need to investigate the possible reason behind such a big change, which might have saved the romance. How about *Marguerite* herself? She is the martyr, and she sacrificed all, even her love. But is that pure? Just as stated in the mail, seems she also had the intention to redeem herself by sacrificing the love.

The time in the country they had been living together for several months is the time that is worthy all the suffering they both underwent. And the pure love and high passion between these two lovers is so powerful, and it's easy to get lost into it magically. We might expect they could spend the time together towards the end of *Marguerite*'s life, so that's a happy ending, but the loneliness and the misery she had at the bed when she was dying, and her vague hope of his coming to see her, and his failure of see her for the last time, all contribute to the sadness and tragedy of the story. When we look back at *Armand*'s weird and horrible behavior of unearthing her grave, opening the coffin, and seeing her *body* for the last time, it seems not that weird and horrible, and it just makes perfect sense.

I have to say I love this story very much even though I am just a coward as I said above, who doesn't have enough courage to pursue something really beautiful by giving up everything he possesses. It's a consolation to have such a novel to be able to relate.
