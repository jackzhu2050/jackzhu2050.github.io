Walter Isaacson is absolutely a great author who is very good at writing biography, e.g the famous
*Steve Jobs*, *Einstein*, etc. Each book is very decent and well-written and once it's published
it immediately becomes the must-read for that person or subject.

*The Innovators* is a special one which doesn't cover any particular person, but a group of people behind
the development of digital age and its technology. He originated it to hundreds of years ago, e.g 
*Ada Lovelace* was heavily covered and also mentioned a lot later. *Ada* was very talented for sure and also
very visionary who claimed that a machine(later "computer") could do everything that people ask it to do but
it couldn't create original thoughts like human. That's a strong claim, and it stands till today and seems
we just followed her prediction exactly to have a powerful computer but not that powerful to be able to think 
by itself.

Computers were not very new in ideas, and we human wanted to get rid of the chore of calculating for centuries. 
And generation after generation, peopled tried to materialize the ideas to something tangible and useful. Till
40s and 50s, the actual computers were devised and materialized, which allowed people to play with and were used
mainly in military and academy. They were huge in size and expensive in price, so it was expected to have a way 
to make it more accessible to common people.

Finally transistors and microprocessors were invented and Moore's law was proposed which were later proved to be true.
And the size of computers became smaller each year and also the price became lower and lower. Then people could buy
it just like a home appliance, esp. after Apple II and Macintosh. Besides the hardware, software started to prosper
e.g Bill Gate's Microsoft which dominated nearly the entire marketing of operating system. More and more people could
buy their own computers as the personal computers.

With the computers there, people were also trying to share knowledge or experience. Then the network idea was obvious, but
how to connect all computers and how to design the network were some questions to answer. Later with the protocols being designed
and implemented, computers were able to talk to each other and Internet was born. Initially only BBS or usegroup were there
for people to share ideas, until Tim invented the WWW single-handedly. Then PCs and Internet started to progress faster and 
faster which were no longer a tool to do calculations but could do almost everything as *Ada* claimed nearly 200 years ago.

When more sites and pages were on the web, how to find the useful site and page became very important. Yahoo's directory was
the first trial and then came the Google. Of course we all know that Google won. With Google, people could quickly find whatever
they wanted either for their study, work or entertainment.

And at last, it came to *Ada*'s bold claim that computers couldn't create original thoughts, which is AI as we call it today.
Is the current stage of AI something that could impress Ms Ada? I don't think so. Today, years after the author's book, with
the popular ChatGPT, can we say the AI is almost there? Maybe not, we are still trying and watching to see how it turns out. 
Will it be just another hype like before, or this time it's just different? Let's wait and see.

As the author mentioned the best innovation were from the collaboration among a diverse group of people. A single person could
hardly achieve anything big and impactful. Combining the art and science to create something easy to use and also fun to use
might create something new, like PC, Internet, WWW, iPhone, Tesla, or ChatGPT, etc.
