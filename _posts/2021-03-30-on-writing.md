*Stephen King* might be the writer who sells the most books, and also a lot of movies have been adopted from his books. I've been knowing his name for a long time but never read a book so far, which might be because that I don't like suspense books that much or I don't put enough weight to this genre comparing to other serious literature. But I have to admit that reading such books is really a huge fun without thinking too much or too deep or getting bored. Readers vote using their money, which might prove there might be something important that I cannot see from his work. That's why I picked this book to learn more about his ideas about writing and as a plus, it also includes his short memoir.

The memoir part is what I love better, which is so vivid and colorful and even easy to relate. The babysitter big girl put her fat ass over little Stephen's head and farted with something smelly and loud, which reminds me my young age. It was not a fat girl but a fat boy(why always fat?), who enjoyed a lot farting over your face with a shocking sudden. And he also enjoyed attacking you using his fingers(imagine folding your hands with two index fingers sticking out) on your ass while your were urining with full attention. I still can feel the pain as it just comes again.

I didn't know much about *Stephen* before this reading, and I didn't expect he was so poor with a very difficult start as a writer. While he was a teacher teaching English, he kept writing at nights. He took other parttime jobs to support his family while keeping writing. He left a bunch of rejection notes to remind him to keep going. That's why I really believe him when he ended up the book with the answer to *why he writes*, not for money, not for fame, not for sex, but for happines, for the writer himself and also for the readers.

The accident was all of a sudden. I love long walking too, while listening to some interesting podcast or audio books. *Stephen* was hit by a van which nearly killed him, while writing alleviated the pain in some way after returning home from hospital. I am not sure whether he would get back to his routine of walking after full recovery or he would be more careful and dropped the hobby completely. I hope it would be the first. I might say people always underestimate the risk before something bad gets you while they overestimate the risk after it. But the truth is that car accidents are really bad and must be taken more seriously.

Getting back to the writing, one thing I agree with is about the overuse of the adverbs, e.g "He gave a stare angrily but also sexually". It comes to a feeling of vagueness even though we could derive the meaning and sense. But it's kinda lazy and inelegant. It could be put in another way more subtle which allows the reader to figure out and feel from the conversations or actions instead of a direct adverb. This just reminds me of a saying I read from a book(I forgot the name) and the writer argues that you shouldn't use *chengyu* (Chinese idioms) at all to avoid the vagueness. I think these two arguments echo with each other.

I love his candor regarding writing, and also his view about life, which might be the reason why his books are very easy to resonate. And that's why I am eager to read his novel now.
