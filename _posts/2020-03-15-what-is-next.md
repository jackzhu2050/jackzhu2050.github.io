You must have heard something like "A new financial crisis has come" or "you live too long to see the rare events".
We're talking about stocks, oil, and the economy. It's just like a roller coaster which plummeted by 10% and then rallied by 10% within one week. Normally I believe the Done Jones Industry Index(DJIA) is more stable and immunes from outside forces, while this time it just taught me a lesson. Your money in stocks must have shrunk so much and you must have been wondering how to handle your position.

It is same here in China, and our SSE Index has also plummeted a lot, which just makes the profit of the previous period of bull market gone, or even ends up being losing a lot of money. Every expert or article we can read are suggesting us to sell and cash is the king for now. You might feel so regreted if you just sold all. At least we can expect a big rise on Monday.

Two reasons to behold such confidence. 

First, DJIA has rallied ~10% in one day which is huge. And SSE will react to that for sure, since the US market is still the biggest one in the world. How much we can expect to rise in SSE might be out of view, since two days in the weekend are inundated with so much news, either positive or negative, which will introduce more uncertainty for sure.

Second, Trump announced the national emergence last Friday, which will relieve a lot of people's concerns about the spreading of conorovirus. At least, the US government and people will pay more attention to the virus by closing the school, suspending the sports events, forbidding the public events, etc. While the virus is still spreading quickly across the world, different voices will emerge. A lot of people might oppose the aggresive ways like China, while others might want to put the life over everything else. Such disagreement will give us the chance to rethink ourselves as we did in the last months in China.

So the financial market will recover for a bit but whether we can and how long we can maintain such momentum  is still an open question. We'll stare the numbers of the infectious people everyday as we did everyday last several months for our numbers. We hope the virus could be contained as quickly as possible to avoid the real crisis.

Recently I am obsessed with Probability an Statistics. I am reading books about them. This is not just a tool but might be a very important thing to change the way we look at the world. Normally we will ignore the events with very low probability, i.e so-called *the black swan*. While 2020, as it unfolds itself, the black swan events are taking place. Chinese people are confined in their home for months, even when it's the Spring Festival. Now it spreads to the whole world. The stock market became upended quickly for the US by ending its bull market which lasts for years. The NBA has been suspended, and the Olympic Games might also be postponed or canceled.

Looking at my kid who is drawing a picture outside my study, I am very worried about her future. Humans are so vulnerable, while rare things are no longer that rare. Last epidemic is SARS in 2003 when she was not born yet. For this pandemic in 2020 she is living that with us. She hasn't stepped out of the home for months which is so unimaginable and surreal as for a naughty girl at her age.

But what might be the next? 

Who can tell and who can be sure?
