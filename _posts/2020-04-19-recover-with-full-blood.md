The title might seems a very weird saying, since it's adopted from a Chinese slang, which means recovering from something bad completely like a fresh. Yes, that's just what I am feeling now. Recovering from fever might sounds trivial, while the feeling itself is great, no matter what it is about appetite, sleep, pain, or whatever. Free from headache, free from sleep deprivation, free from medicine, all feel so good.

So we went out to a park nearby. Weather is really nice, and people are jammed altogether. I guess that might be due to the long-time quarantine indoors. Many flowers are blooming, and it is breezing around. Walking along the path, up and down, along the hills. Not far away, there's a lake. Kids are playing with the water by shooting around. Parents are watching over with cautions. 

We set up the tent on the grass, laying over our back, taking photos. It feels very nice laying there, with sunshine flows in, with breeze touches our body, with the nice smell of the flowers. We talk about the future with great passion. People pass by, and you can feel the smile even when they are wearing the masks.

The traffic was very bad when driving back home. A lot of impatient drivers just cut in front you like what they normally do before the pandemic. With a slight sigh, I guess a lot of things have returned.

Having dinner, we made an appointment to camp in a distant part next time together to avoid the crowd, which might be better I suppose.
