It always fascinates me to hear stories about Columbus, Darwin, Einstein, etc. They are trying something brand-new, something far from a quick success, something most people never have the courage to start with. They make the decision, and they embark on the arduous trip, and they might end up being dead, or reaching a dead end, or very few with a great fame. While the outcome differs, the moment of making the decision and the process of reaching that goal always inspire me and even encourage me to learn from them. And that kind of endeavor(most are doomed to be in vain and futile) with a clear and ambitious goal is something that pushes humankind ahead and is the defining time of civilization progress.

Computers are the most impressive and impactful invention of the last half century. The MacBook I am using to write this post, and the small sophisticated iPhone within the reach hold my knowledge and my social connections, which nobody could imagine to be possible. If we compare the first room-sized computer with this tiny more powerful smartphone, we can feel the huge progress over the time. But how did it happen?

*Moore's Law* is something everyone should appreciate. Anything(e.g a industry, a subject, the study of a disease, etc) can reach a very advanced stage if it could be improved twice better every 18 months. It's not a 10% compound rate, but 200%. With the open standard, different manufacturers and companies could try their best to make the components faster, cheaper, more reliable and more energy-efficient. And we can see everything around us to have a *heart* (a versatile chip) to be smart as possible even though most is still very dummy.

In 70s and 80s of last century, it was a golden time for designing and making computers. The hardwares and softwares were not that sophisticated, and OEM was still on the way, so a company had to do nearly everything when making a computer. This book *The Soul of a New Machine* is a story with the detailed narrative about such effort. The book is not technical but more about the tensions and challenges of the process, whether it was about the resources, or about the relationship among people.

*Tom West* led the team to build such a *monster* without good support from the company at the basement, with a bunch of newbies, working overtime for 18 months(why this number appears again?). Of course it was not easy and always at the edge of breaking down, but it finally delivered the product as promised.

The story itself is fantastic, but it resonates with me a lot and suddenly brings me back to the days when I was in a startup. We didn't have an office, which is not that surprising, and engineers were either part-time or new graduates(like me), and the teams was small, but the idea was new and promising. The founder was able to secure a deal of an investment and we moved to a building near Tsinghua Univ. The team was expanded from four to over twenty. And the games we developed made some money but still far from breaking the tie. The founder was smart and bought a game which was proved to be a huge success later and we finally moved to a bigger office.

The founder of my then company surely shouldered huge pressure, esp. when our games could make a hit in the market. And people in the company started to become weary and couldn't see any hint of light in the dark tunnel. You didn't know when would be the end of the darkness and the beginning of a bright future. People went and came. When it didn't pan out, the blames would go to the founder and seems anything he did would be wrong.

The interesting thing was that the company finally picked up and made a few hits(it's so difficult to make a hit in gaming market), and the founder became a billionaire and everyone complimented him as a genius and forgot we were almost bankrupt. Years later when the first a few colleagues gathered in Beijing, we talked about those days and the founder. We still made jokes about how he did things, but we all agreed that he was ambitious and aggressive but he also was a person to be able to achieve the goal recklessly.

"I will definitely go with him if we would start a company again." A college who made the most jokes about the founder concluded and everyone else echoed.

I wish I could read this book when I just graduated which might lend me some lessons about how things work, esp. for the startups. If it's new, it must be chaotic. The new thing is doomed to fail for 99% cases, but for the remaining 1%, it will be disruptive and become a huge success. But the thing is that you don't know which group you belong to, and probability tells you that you would nearly fall into the former group for sure. But a lot of guys are still trying their best to join and enjoy the new adventure like Columbus, Darwin and Einstein. Why is that? I guess that's because we're not just ruled by the probability, but also the enthusiasm and the passion of doing the new things and taking the big responsibility and pushing the new frontline and enjoying the challenge.

The new machine *Eagle* was finally released to the market and was proved to be a success. But the members of that heroic team was gradually dismissed and scattered here and there for different reasons. They might think they were under-treated and were not given enough appreciation and credit, but they all agreed that the 18-month adventure was a huge and wonderful journey of their life.

"It was an amazing experience" we said goodbye to each other at the end of that Beijing gathering with a tacit agreement and the stars in the sky were shining with our mind wandering in new adventures.
