Yang has left from the presidential election.

Still being vivid to me when I first heard this name, Andrew Yang, from then a friend and boss. We talked inside a cab in Waitan Shanghai. The catholic buildings standing on the right side of the street were glowing with yellow warm light. Flags were flapping in the breeze. Everything was good and prosperous as I can imagine about the future of our company, and also about Yang's course towards the presidency.

Then I paid more attention to that guy. Hence, I listened to a dozen of podcasts about him, watched some videos about him, and also read some newspaper articles, though he was always underrepresented comparing to other Democratic candidates in medias. 

The talk between Yang and Joe Rogan was a very interesting one and brought him a good deal of public traction. I was never a fan of UBI and weighed more its cons over its pros if exists. While Yang talked about the future of labor marketing esp. when the automation would be heavily deployed. Not only the theory in his mind or on paper, he also did a deep research about the ordinary people, e.g the truck drivers, which are so vulnerable to the impending self-driving trucks that are expected to come within years, not decades.

We all believe in earning our lives by hardworking not from the welfare which in our heart is more fair and can push the society to a better place. However we might also ought to be open to other opinions like Yang's, which might not change a bit of our stone-like belief while it can open a window allowing a bit puff of air to get in and come out.

Now Yang has officially ended his course towards American presidency while no one can deny he did a really good job in his way so far. From a underdog holding an unorthodox idea to a very competitive candidate with a great many of fans, he again proved the American dream undoubtedly, though he is so near to that end.

He will be missed for sure.

The ride and talk in that cab will also be missed for sure.
